# Hi! I'm Ruben! This is my project page.

## Software Engineering Project: 
### [Data Royale](https://github.com/Herxity/SWE2024)
- Designed architecture for automated container deployment and management for Machine Learning(ML) models 
- Utilized Docker for ease of deployment of ML models, as well as hardware resource limitation enforcement
- Designed system-wide real-time hardware resource management, written in NodeJS interfacing with the existing Docker Daemon on the server
- Utilizes asynchronous request processing and dynamic routing of API requests from users to Docker containers
- Automatically issues and validates API tokens per-user
- Interfaces with Stripe billing system, increasing userâ€™s rate given higher resource consumption
- Automated ML Algorithm validation and metrics recording

## Embedded Systems Projects
### [GRISC Microprocessor](https://github.com/Herxity/Herxity.github.io/blob/3b46cbfc1ecfe9202b216c69bd263a1b0e1240cc/Embedded%20Systems%20Lab%205.pdf)
- Deployed on a Zybo Zynq-7 interfacing with VGA and UART
- Fully equipped with a Controller, ALU, Clock Dividers, Debouncers, UART interface, VGA interface, Registers, and instruction memory
- Accepts GRISC assembly instructions
- Designed in VHDL using Xilinx Vivado

## Machine Learning Project
### Multimodal Anomaly Detection Model:
- Machine learning model which accepts multimodal sensor data from a smartphone
- Runs in real-time on a Flask Server with devices on LAN networks
- Created a Machine Learning based system for classification of user actions in real-time into 3 different classes using PyTorch
- Tested performance between a Long-Short Term Memory Model, Transformer Encoder, and a Deep Convolutional Neural Network for classification of Time Series Sensor Data
- Achieved a test accuracy of 96% on our best model for classification tasks
