&lt;c001&gt;&lt;p003&gt;
As the day draws to a close, near the steps of a rustic-looking abandoned home, on the outskirts of a small village, the excited voices of children could be heard amidst the sounds of crickets...
&quot;Neo! Neo! Tell it again!&quot; a young boy with brown hair says to the older boy sitting in front of him.
&quot;Haven&#39;t you had enough already Clay? It&#39;s the 3rd time I&#39;ve told you today!&quot; the older boy responds exasperated.
&quot;No fair Neo! We found birds in the forest with you and Louis yesterday! You promised!&quot; a young girl sitting next to Clay whines, &quot;After all, you didn&#39;t want to go rabbit-hunting with us today.&quot;
&quot;You too, Thia? What&#39;s gotten into you two? It&#39;s not like the story changes because I tell it,&quot; Neo says, &quot;Also, we don&#39;t want to get in the way of the hunters Thia, you know that.&quot;
&quot;Neo, you promised me, and Thia! A promise is a promise!&quot; Clay crosses his arms, sitting down in front of Neo.
&quot;Yeah!&quot; Thia follows.
&quot;Okay okay… but this’ll be the last time today.&quot;
--

&quot;NEO WE NEED TO SAVE HER!&quot; Clay thrashes in Neos arms, desperately trying to get away, tears stream down his face while trying to steel himself to face the things ahead of him,
&quot;STOP PLAYING HERO! YOU&#39;LL DIE TOO!&quot;
Thia&#39;s injured form was laying on the ground behind them, Clay could only watch as the shadowy humanoid creatures crept closer to her, and how he could only get farther away.
Neo was running and kept running. All he knew was running. Neo ran into the forest. He knew these grounds. A few hours north was a vassal city to the War God. Certainly someone there would help.
However, he felt a sharp pain in his leg and fell. Clay tumbled a few feet ahead of him. Neo looked at his leg and saw a purplish chain around his leg, covered in spikes and dug into his ankle as if they were teeth. In an instant, his body was dragged back in the direction he ran from, leaving Clay alone.

&lt;h1&gt;Chapter 1 - Beginnings of Heroism&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p002&gt;
The combination of light shoveling and the morning sun piercing through the blinds wakes me up from the dream. The Old Man outside is definitely shoveling the snow from yesterday out of the vegetable garden.
I get up and yell through the window, &quot;Oi! Grimstone! Must be cold out there!&quot;
Looking startled by the noise he takes a defensive stance and attempts to figure out the source of the voice, before aiming his shovel at me.
&quot;Oh! Look who finally woke up&quot; he says chuckling.
&quot;You&#39;re crazy,&quot; I said, &quot;getting up this early and going out in the cold.&quot;
He scoops up a shovelful of snow and raises it towards the window, &quot;Well you&#39;re coming out to help me dig out the snow unless you&#39;d like me to toss it into your room.&quot;
Although his voice is muffled through the glass at his cold-hearted threat, I grab my cloak and head outside.  
The reflection off the snow shone strongly into my eyes and I needed to take a minute to adjust. I veil my eyes with one hand, and with the other, I reach around the porch till I find the shovel. The old wood creaks as I make my way down to the garden.
As I descend the steps, I reminisce about that old story I always wanted to hear. That old legend of the Gods always fascinated me. Perhaps I&#39;ll...

[[..ask Grimstone about the Gods]]
[[...keep it to myself]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="..ask Grimstone about the Gods" tags="Done" position="250,125" size="100,100">...ask Grimstone about the Gods. He might have a variation of that old story hidden somewhere here.

&quot;Hey Grim, you remember the old story about the 6 Gods and Seraphus?&quot;, I reach for a shovel.

&quot;That old tale? That&#39;s just what the Bards say&quot;, says Grimstone. He flings some snow back and I duck under it.

&quot;What? You don&#39;t believe it?&quot;, I replied, confused at his doubtful tone towards the legend.

&quot;It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t believe, but I don&#39;t necessarily see it as something to be believed either.&quot;

&quot;So you do or don&#39;t believe? Why are you being so wishy-washy about it.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ll understand when you gaze upon this world with the same eyes as I do one day, Clay.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re sayin&#39; I&#39;m gonna be blind someday too?&quot;

&quot;How many times must I tell you, I am not blind. I merely choose to not see.&quot;

&quot;Right, just like yesterday when you chose to let that scummy merchant swindle us out of a Monarch Gold coin? You know how long we need to work to earn that back?!&quot;, I clutch my forehead trying to calm my nerves. &quot;You don&#39;t even notice when the merchants are pushing on the arms of the scales when weighing merchandise! How! You don&#39;t even use your eyes and still can fight, yet somehow your &#39;blindsight&#39; just fails in basic human interaction?!&quot;

&quot;I tell you time and time again, money comes and goes-&quot;

&quot;Yes well, when it goes entirely, then the food goes as well.&quot;

&quot;Did you miss part where I said that money comes? My alchemy has been quite profitable as of late.... let&#39;s see that is....&quot;, he reaches into his satchel and pulls out a small coin pouch, shaking it in his hand.

&quot;Twenty gold coins!&quot;, he says with a smile.

&quot;And we&#39;re how much in debt again?&quot;

&quot;Two thousand.&quot;, the old man replies plainly, the smile fading.

&quot;So basically, we got less than negative nineteen hundred coins to our name. This really isn&#39;t our money to be losing, Old Man.&quot;

&quot;You worry too much. Anyways, keep shoveling, this snow won&#39;t clear from our walkway itself.&quot;

I look sideways at him, squinting, &quot;Wait. Do you not have fire magic?&quot;

&quot;Yes? What of it?&quot;

I rest my head against the shovel, trying to maintain my composure, &quot;Well, why not....I dunno, crazy idea....but maybe, just maybe.....USE IT?!&quot;, I may or may not have lost my composure.

&quot;Ah, but that takes the joy out of the process.&quot;

I roll my eyes and continue plowing through the snow.

[[We finish shoveling...]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="...keep it to myself" tags="Done" position="550,125" size="100,100">Some time passes, and we&#39;ve been shoveling in relative silence.

Eventually Grimstone speaks up, &quot;Well Clay, I must say, lately you&#39;ve started to become very capable.&quot;

&quot;What does that mean...?&quot;

&quot;It means, I think you&#39;ve reached the age where you can finally care for yourself: in terms of magical education.&quot;

Oh good. I thought he was going to kick me out, I&#39;ve broken his windows more times than I can count lately. &quot;Really? Does this mean you won&#39;t be teaching me anymore?&quot;

&quot;That is correct. I took you in and promised I&#39;d teach you the fundamentals of magic, but now that you&#39;ve come this far, I think you can start conducting your own research.&quot;

&quot;Research?!&quot;

&quot;Yes, research. Of course, you don&#39;t need to start off creating your own spells or schools of magic like I did, you could start off with something as benign as reading on a class of spells you&#39;re unfamiliar with. Either way, you&#39;re now primed to teach yourself from now on.&quot;

&quot;Teach myself? What? C&#39;mon Grim, you&#39;re not that old, surely you can keep going.&quot;

&quot;No no Clay, that is definitely not the issue&quot;, Grim responds shaking his head,&quot;This is all a part of you maturing. You need to learn to survive on your own. You have all the skills now, but now you need to practice doing it.&quot;

&quot;I guess&quot;, Grim&#39;s reasoning seems untouchable

[[We finish shoveling...]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="...draw my sword and strike" tags="Done" position="300,300" size="100,100">Of course I need to attack, we&#39;re near the Serpent Valley. The monsters here are leagues above your average skeleton.

I reach for my sword. Even disoriented, I&#39;d know where it is. I swing it out in an arc in front of me, but it bounces off with a *CLANG.* I lost my grip on the blade and it flew somewhere.

I channel energy to my hands. 

It doesn&#39;t matter what&#39;s in front of me. I have to kill it. I need to kill it before it kills me.

&quot;Lay waste to my enemies, &lt;FLAMING WIND&gt;-&quot;

&quot;CLAY GET A HOLD OF YOURSELF, CHILD!&quot;

I cut the activation short. The Old Man&#39;s voice echos through the cave. My eyes feel like they have started to adjust to the darkness, and I make out the vague shape of a man with misshapen hair. 

&quot;Clay, I told you not to fly blind&quot;, I can hear him shaking his head from his voice. I feel him grab my arm and drag me up.

He casts healing spells on me, and all I can do is mutter, trying to think of something to say. I still haven&#39;t mastered fighting without sight as he can. I&#39;m not even a novice. Moving without sight is not even feasible for me. How am I supposed to advance? I&#39;m a capable fighter, but unless I can do what seems impossible, what&#39;s left?

&quot;Clay...&quot;, his voice bears down on me. 

Oh boy....I&#39;m in for it, aren&#39;t I....?

&quot;Y-yes?&quot;

&quot;No more using `&lt;Blind Leap&gt;`. Got it? It&#39;s still beyond your skill range.&quot;

&quot;B-...fine.&quot;

I can&#39;t seem to defend myself. Grimstone&#39;s techniques are still leagues ahead of mine. 

&quot;Hm...What an interesting Cave.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s so special about it?&quot;


&quot;The way it winds downwards and around, it seems to go on in circles and twisting, and it seems like it reaches the surface at another point here. The mine seems to really start at the lowest point.&quot;
&quot;Didn&#39;t Seraphus once fight Morrigan here? She could&#39;ve dug into the ground and formed the tunnels with her body while slithering through the rocks.&quot;

&quot;Perhaps...but if so....there seems to be an eerie lack of monsters here.&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s be thankful that there is an eerie lack of monsters.&quot;

After a few minutes, Grimstone pipes up, &quot;Well, I believe the lower levels of the mine should begin right here.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;re you talking about there&#39;s nothing there it&#39;s just more ro-&quot;

He takes his staff and props it against a boulder, pushing it aside effortlessly, revealing a stretch of tunnels that seem much more man-made. 

I&#39;m dumbfounded.

&quot;Clay, remember your breathing incantations. The air down here likely is not pure.&quot;

&quot;Yes yes...*Oh wind that breathes life to those who accept it, become as a veil to guard me against impurity. Let my words speak peace and my chest bear life. The wind holds with it the stories of our ancestors, the tales of heroism, of failure, of life, of death....&quot;*

The only sound that fills the cave are our footsteps, and the muttering of the near-endless incantation.

As we continue to walk through the cave, I notice the sparkling of some gems. These aren&#39;t useful gems, however. The most common crystal, Earth Mica, is flimsy yet has a distinct shine to it. It has no real use...speaking of useless...

&quot;Hey Grimstone?&quot;

&quot;Why do I feel like you&#39;re secretly mocking me?&quot;

Dammit, he saw right through me. Well he&#39;s blind so...heard through me? Sensed through me? Tasted through me? Smelled through me? I shrug, pointing at the stretch of tunnels before us, &quot;Mockery aside-&quot;

&quot;So you were-?&quot;,  he turns towards me suddenly.

I continue, &quot;-how much further do we need to go?&quot;

&quot;Tsk,&quot; he wacks his staff against the floor and waits a moment, &quot;about 30 steps this way&quot;, he takes a turn at a fork in the tunnel that I hadn&#39;t even noticed. I begin counting steps.

&quot;Here we are,&quot; he stretches his arms out, pointing towards something in the darkness up ahead.

&quot;-No reaction? Oh it must be dark then.&quot;

Right on the money. He creates a small flame at the end of his finger, then condenses it into a shining orb, increasing the intensity. Shielding my eyes from the light source itself, I begin to see red gems all across the ground and cave walls.

MONEY.

ALL I SEE IS MONEY.

WE WILL FINALLY BE OUT OF DEBT.

AND THIS IS ENOUGH TO LIVE IN LUXURY.

*rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh*

&quot;Grim was that you?&quot;

&quot;No...?&quot;

I feel a knot form in my chest, as I look towards the large cave chamber.

The area seems large and mostly vacant in the middle. There is a large mass of shifting stones there but nothing else.

Wait.

Shifting stones?

&quot;Grimstone is that aURHG-&quot;, something yanks me off to the side.

Where I was standing, a spike made of red crystal took its place, Grimstone pulled me away by my collar.

&quot;...Crystal dragon, and a strong one too, it seems.&quot;

The shifting mass of stones in the middle of the room begins to form into a ferocious lizard-like creature, with a face resembling a rhinoceros, but broader and more like a shield. The back is covered in spiked crystals, along with a swinging tail whose end is a dense mass of rock with spikes of the same kind. The front of this creature seems to be adorned in crystalline armor.

Grimstone thinks it over, &quot;If there&#39;s a Crystal Dragon here, that means that the crystals here are all the unusable...except...&quot;

I gesture towards him to continue, I don&#39;t want to cut off my breathing incantation.

&quot;The dragon&#39;s horn, on its nose. The only crystal that won&#39;t cause any real harm to anything...aside from us if it hits us.&quot;

[[We have to go on the offensive]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="We have to go on the offensive" tags="Done" position="425,425" size="100,100">Risk? Pfft. I&#39;ve fought tougher opponents.

Namely, Grimstone.

I tug on Grimstone&#39;s sleeve, he knows I want to fight it.

The Dragon is settling into it&#39;s form, we have a few more seconds before it starts charging at us.

&quot;...don&#39;t do anything foolish, understood?&quot;

I nod.

We split up, I begin running from the right down a sloped section of the cave room alongside the wall, and hide behind a Stalagmite of red Crystal. I have to make sure I don&#39;t touch the crystal, they cause serious burns. The Dragon seems to be facing Grimstone. I&#39;m on its right side now.

The plan is to get to flank it, and hit the weak points in it&#39;s armor. Easier said than done.

&quot;&lt;i&gt;`&lt;Earth Spire&gt;`&lt;/i&gt;!&quot;

A spike of rock slams diagonally up and into the side of the Crystal Dragon, but the rock crumbles on impact. 

&quot;&lt;b&gt;GRAWWWWWHHH&lt;b&gt;!!!&quot;

We may have angered it. 

It begins charging in the direction of Grimstone, who begins to charge at it also.

That fool has no idea how dangerous that is. Charging straight at Grimstone? Worst decision you could make.

Right as they are about to collide, the Dragon swings its head up to attempt to screwer Grimstone, but he seemingly vanishes. 

Grimstone&#39;s not on the ground.

I look up, he wasn&#39;t tossed into the cave ceiling either.

&quot;AHAAHA, YOU HAVE SOME FIGHT IN YA, OLD SPORT?&quot;

Grimstone says, clinging to the Dragon&#39;s horn.

The Dragon seems to be enraged at this development, and begins flailing it&#39;s face around.

That&#39;s my queue, I grab the charm attached to my necklace, and pour mana into it. My lungs suddenly expand, and I start chanting.

&quot;*Oh unceasing tide that flows through the world, open your floodgates upon my enemies, and let the ocean&#39;s majesty be made manifest, `&lt;Water Surge&gt;`!&quot;*

As I conclude the chant, I leap out from behind the stalagmite, and aim my hand at the Crystal Dragon.

*3....2....1....Release!*

A massive torrent of water shoots from my hand, the Crystal Dragon is engulfed in it, and Grimstone casts his spell in response,&quot;`&lt;Rage of Frostwing&gt;`!&quot;

A chill ran through my body as I watched icy frost envelop the Crystal Dragon. Its body began to slowly crack and split, the light in its eyes faded. I took a look at myself: I was shivering, and the hairs on my arms were covered in frost as well. Grimstone lept to me and created a flame in his hands and handed me the flame. The small flame is  slowly helping, I feel my hands growing warmer. I turn to Grimstone and say, &quot;I-Is it dead?&quot;

&quot;No&quot;, he replies, &quot;the core is intact.&quot;

He walks over to the froze Crystal Dragon body, and reaches to the horn, it&#39;s mostly covered in ice. It seems like you could take it off if you saw it or wit-

&lt;i&gt;CRACK&lt;/i&gt;

&quot;Item Retrieved, shall we go, Clay?&quot; Grimstone pockets the newly acquired Serpent Diamond shaped as a Crystal Dragon horn.

How much strength does it even require to remove it like that is beyond me.

&quot;Yeah, time to head back to Lord WhatsHisface.&quot;


***

Me and Grimstone finally reached Tomb again. The cool night air makes the city street feel even more silent. Crowgarden&#39;s streets are really is dead(at night, that is).

I sense something.

&quot;Clay, stop&quot;, Grimstone puts a hand out in front of me, &quot;We are being followed.&quot;

Grimstone seems to agree, the air feels stale...dry...dead.

&quot;My my, if it isn&#39;t Grimmy~.&quot;

Who in the world is this? Only I get to give my master stupid names, and even &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; don&#39;t give names this bad.

&quot;... CLAY RUN!&quot;

[[I run]]

[[I pretend to Run]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="I run" tags="Green" position="225,550" size="100,100">If Grimstone is telling me to run, it&#39;s probably serious. No, it&#39;s definitely serious. I have to escape, else I risk holding him back.

I break out into a sprint, and hear the two combatants&#39; voices being lost in the wind rushing past my face. All I can do is leave it to Grimstone.

***

&quot;...good grief that was tirin- what in blazes? Clay, why are you covered in-&lt;i&gt;what is that..18...19... &lt;/i&gt;-20 charms!?&quot;, Grimstone says as he enters our room at the inn.

&quot;To prepare for danger&quot;, I point in the direction of the fight from my bed.

&quot;I understand that bit but she wasn&#39;t so much a threat as she was...&quot;, Grimstone gets lost in thought, furrows his brow, before arriving at some realization, &quot;A MASSIVE THREAT TO THE KINGDOM. AH YES, PRECISELY! IT WAS QUITE A DANGEROUS FIGHT AND I HAD TO USE ALL MY POWER-&quot;

A series of thuds comes from the wall connecting us to the adjacent room, &quot;SHUT YER TRAP IT&#39;S NOT EVEN SUNRISE, YEAH?&quot;

Grimstone quiets down and continues, &quot;-yes all my power to defeat this opponent. Who I had fought. And triumphed over. Gloriously.&quot;

Truly this must have been a battle of epic proportions.

&quot;Anyways...&quot;, his voice trails off,&quot;as I had returned from battle I had stumbled upon some information by complete chance that may aid us in our search for a perfect spot. Get some rest now!&quot;, Grimstone heads straight to bed and blows out the candle.

I try and imagine the wreckage in the city street after that fight. Man. I sure hope nobody can trace it back to him, else that&#39;s even more we need to work to someday live debt-free.

I drift off to sleep and soon morning follows.

***

&quot;Ehnd ehn, ey shaw a bigh rom fer erf jehrmstawhns, erernt dert thert neyt?&quot;, Grimstone says while stuffing his face with a honeyed chicken skewer in one hand and a cup of stew in the other.

&quot;Grim...this is the third time this conversation I&#39;ve needed to tell you this. Don&#39;t speak with your mouth full. It&#39;s gross and nobody understands what you say&quot;, I pull up my hood so nobody sees that it&#39;s me with this walking embarassment of an adult.

&quot;Fern fern cherld,&quot; Grimstone finishes chewing, &quot;Ahem. What I meant to say was &#39;And then I saw a big room full of gemstones, isn&#39;t that neat?&#39; Honestly, it doesn&#39;t seem that hard to follow even while I&#39;m eating.&quot; 

&quot;Whatever whatever...the details of your dreams aren&#39;t even that important right now. We need to find that place you mentioned.&quot;

&quot;Oh, why didn&#39;t you say so? It was over there?&quot;, Grimstone points behind us and then jogs off in that direction.

&quot;Are you kidding me!? &lt;i&gt;Dammit you little-&lt;/i&gt; Wait up!&quot;, I break out into a sprint. He hardly even seems like he&#39;s trying and he&#39;s already there.

By the time I arrive I see two kids on a wagon laughing while bidding farewell. They crack the reins and their horse moves. I feel like I&#39;ve seen these two kids before.

&quot;Well, Clay. What do you think?&quot;, Grimstone stands proudly, placing the &#39;Grimstone&#39;s Stones&#39; signs down firmly on the ground. 

&quot;This is...how did... WHAT?&quot;, I grab Grimstone by the shoulders, &quot;HOW DID YOU MANAGE TO FIND SUCH A CONVENIENT SETUP?&quot; It stands right in front of the most important building in both the city and for the Rite of Prophecy. Look at that subtle placement in broad daylight with no shade. The tasteful distance from the food and souvenir stalls. Oh my God. It&#39;s even close to the depiction of this year&#39;s Crusader.

&quot;HA! That&#39;s a merchant secret I cannot divulge&quot;, he stomps on the ground. In an instant, the earth around him reforms into the exact shape of our typical merchant stall. A passing mage was heard in the distance screaming out in shock, babbling on about an impossibly precise use of Earth Magic, before fainting. &quot;Let&#39;s get to work, Clay!&quot;

And so we begin unloading our bags onto the shlves of earth moulded behind us. The security runes carved into the front edge of the shelves are pre-carved when he created the stall, all they needed was some power. I drag my hand along each rune, focusing intently on the meaning of each symbol. Each rune begins to glow a faint red. I test out the seal by poking a stick into the shelves. It doesn&#39;t budge. 

The other merchants around us are in shock at the whole process.

&quot;Y-you there! Do you offer services for automatic stall construction??&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll pay double- no, TRIPLE whatever the next person offers.&quot;

&quot;Please tell me you do private contracts??&quot;

Grimstone holds up his hands and tries to calm the crowd, &quot;Whoah there. The only thing we sell here at &#39;Grimstone&#39;s Stones&#39; are the finest Gemstones this side of the mountains. Besides that, we sell &lt;u&gt;nothing&lt;/u&gt; else.&quot;

The group fizzles out, dejected. 

&quot;Grim, one day you surely will quit trying to be a Gemstone merchant as a full-time career. I get it&#39;s a passion but you&#39;ll never pay off your debts at this rate.&quot;

&quot;Certainly not! Gemstones are irreplaceable!&quot;, Grimstone says as he writes out the prices and names of featured stones on the wooden sign we purchased before the trip.

I roll my eyes and continue stocking the display.

***

&quot;Phew. Done at last,&quot; I stretch my back and legs. 

&quot;This was quicker than expected, looks like we are still free for a bit before sunset,&quot; Grimstone says.

&quot;Great. Time to do our favorite activity.&quot;

&quot;You mean....?&quot;

&quot;Yes I do.&quot;

Me and Grimstone say in unison, &quot;&quot;Window shopping!&quot;&quot;

Grimstone steps out of the stal and takes a brief look around, &quot;Well Clay? Where are you off to?&quot;

I take a look around. Most of the stores feel average save for the smithery stall. I&#39;m tempted to just take a walk through the whole area as opposed to checking out one stall, however. I&#39;ll check out...

[[Tombsword Smithery Stall]]

[[General area]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="I pretend to Run" tags="Done" position="550,725" size="100,100">Grimstone is likely trying to deceive the enemy, I&#39;ll circle back around and flank them.

I break out into a sprint, and hear the two combatants&#39; voices being lost in the wind rushing past my face. I run through an alleyway, but it leads nowhere. 

However, the roofs of the buildings don&#39;t.

&quot;&lt;i&gt;`&lt;Earth Spire&gt;`&lt;/i&gt;!&quot; 

I am propelled up the building, and start running back. I&#39;m already exhausted, but I have to aid Grimstone. My legs feel heavier with every jump. I can see them down on the street ahead.

A cloaked woman and an orange light are the only things I can make out from this distance. 

The woman seems to be walking to Grimstone, but he stands still. He seems to be trying to stall for time.
I brace myself. I&#39;ve never turned a spell against a person before. Realistically, my attack couldn&#39;t kill something that could make Grimstone tell me to run, but it can certainly create an opening. 
About 5 seconds before she reaches Grimstone, there is only one incantation I have that works in this situation, at least against enemies with sight. This spell always causes me to pass out. But I only have one chance.

&quot;&lt;i&gt;Raging Storms...
...Billowing Clouds...&lt;/i&gt;&quot;
It almost feels like the blood in my body is being drawn out of me as I chant.

&quot;...*&lt;i&gt;`&lt;Tempest Strike&gt;`&lt;/i&gt;*.&quot;

My vision goes white.

***

Well. How should I put this?

My heroism seems to not have been appreciated.

So firstly, I must establish: I am not allowed to pass out from casting a spell.

Grimstone says that is an extremely poor quality of a mage, to toss away our consciousness for the sake of a large gamble. 

Secondly: Casting this spell in particular at such a high output will leave me impaired for a day, which is fine.

Except for the fact that tomorrow is when we are supposed to be selling during the Rite.

It&#39;s morning right now, and Grimstone is out running errands. My arms are covered in bandages soaked in herbal oils. Certain herbs help with recovering mana, so maybe I&#39;ll be up by- OH DAMN IT ALL.

I MADE A FOOL OF MYSELF OUT THERE.

So what happened, and it frustrates me to say, is I missed. I hit Grimstone instead of her. Granted, it did scare her off, and Grimstone was unharmed, BUT STILL.

If that was a truly dangerous situation, it means I&#39;d have made a grave mistake.  And to add insult to injury, I was standing too close to the edge of that house I was standing on. So when I passed out, I fell and began rolling down the roof like a bag of potatoes. Grimstone had to catch me, and then take me back to the inn.

*knock knock*

&quot;Good Morning, is Young Master Clay awake. This is Nadia, may I come in?&quot;

Who?

&quot;Who?&quot;

&quot;Nadia, sir. Lord Necron&#39;s servant.&quot;

Oh, I see, Grimstone must have called in a favor.
Damn it.

&quot;Sure, I guess&quot;, I try to pull the covers over my arms, but they are too numb to do anything useful. She comes in, wearing her usual mercenary-type clothing, with a brown cloak that hooks over her right shoulder, and hangs over her left arm. The cloak bears the Necron Family Crest, the image of the weapon Necron itself.

I awkwardly wave my arm at her.

&quot;I see, it seems as bad as he said.&quot;

HUH? AS WHO SAID? WHAT&#39;D THAT USELESS ALCHEMIST SAY? LEMME AT HIM. 

I try to hide my displeasure, &quot;I suppose so...&quot;

&quot;Well, I suppose I will carry out my mission&quot;, she says, grabbing a stool from the end of the room and dragging it to the corner of my bed.

&quot;Mission?&quot;

&quot;Put simply, babysitting. Or perhaps, Clay-sitting,&quot; she tilts her head, thinking of a good way to describe this.

&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;There is no good way to describe this&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

***

Some time went by.

Occasionally, Nadia looks around the room. She seemed intrigued by the collection of gemstones on the table beside me. I try to break the silence, &quot;So, uh, how did Lord Whosits feel about the gem?&quot;

&quot;Lord Necron...&quot;, she stresses the man&#39;s actual name,&quot; seemed most pleased. Upon being informed however that you were injured on the way back, he immediately sent for me to come here.&quot;

I see, he must have felt bad. Damn it.

&quot;Isn&#39;t that nice of him-&quot;

&quot;Yes, Lord Necron is very generous.&quot;

She hardly let me finish my sentence before praising her boss. What a suck-up.

&quot;How are your arms?&quot;, Nadia asks, breaking the silence that crept back.

I move them around a bit, demonstrating they are mostly functional, &quot;They are still useable, but they need to recover fully for me to safely use magic.&quot;

&quot;Magic...so you are both truly mages?&quot;

&quot;Well sort of. I&#39;m more of an apprentice. Grimstone can be considered a true&#39; mage.&quot;

&quot;Even if you are an apprentice, being able to cast spells at your level should classify you as a mage.&quot;

&quot;I guess,&quot; she seems to make some sense,&quot;but I&#39;m still not like Grimstone.&quot;

&quot;Poor comparison.&quot;

&quot;Poor comparison??&quot;

&quot;Yes. You are as bright as you are foolish, Master Clay.&quot;

Take a guy out for dinner first before you insult him, will ya?

&quot;Wouldn&#39;t those cancel out?&quot;

&quot;Not exactly. Yes, you are very quick to learn. But you are still-&quot;

&quot;Alright alright, enough. I get enough of that from the Old Man.&quot;

&quot;Understood.&quot;

She goes silent.

It feels like an eternity goes by.

&quot;Hey, can I go outside?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot;

&quot;Okay but what if I go anyways?&quot;

&quot;I am permitted to use force&quot;, she now seems less maid-like and more bodyguard-like. Crazy how one can flip personas so quickly.

I realize the bandages have mostly run dry, Nadia however already did and had been preparing a new set. It takes her a few minutes, but she replaces them, though they feel tighter.

&quot;I, uh, can&#39;t feel my arms. Mind loosening them at all?&quot;

&quot;It is because you can&#39;t feel them that we have these on you.&quot;

She does have a point. I technically didn&#39;t feel that, I only guessed. My arms still feel like slabs of meat.

This woman&#39;s way of never losing arguments irritates me. I feel even if she were wrong she&#39;d convince me she&#39;s right. 

&quot;What exactly made you want to serve Lord Nero?&quot;
&quot;Lord Necron...&quot;

Ah, so close.

&quot;has many servants. However, my family&#39;s goal has been to serve the Necrons since their establishment. The first of our family, Maximus, was given the surname &#39;Ul-Necron&#39; as a token of appreciation. Ever since then, the Ul-Necrons have served the Necron family proudly.&quot;

&quot;So it&#39;s a family tradition?&quot;
&quot;No. It is our family purpose.&quot;

A purpose? Before you are born? That&#39;s baffling, &quot;So I guess your full name is Nadia Ul-Necron?&quot;

&quot;That is correct. Do you have a family name? If one such as Grimstone were to take someone under his tutelage, they must surely be of high birth.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m more or less his adopted son, disgusting as that sounds to say.&quot;

&quot;Adopted? Well...&quot;, Nadia looks away a little embarassed at having asked.

The conversation more or less died, and eventually I fall asleep.
***


I wake up, it seems Nadia is still here. I guess I nodded off while we were talking.

&quot;Are you feeling any better&quot;, Nadia says, looking up from a book she&#39;s reading.

&quot;I suppose? I can feel up to my elbows now&quot;, I wave my numb hands at her.

She continues, &quot;Very well, I will be going out for a moment to update Lord Necron. Do not leave the room.&quot;

&quot;I will not leave the room, understood.&quot;

She looks at me once more, before walking out the door.

I&#39;m definitely aving the room.

***

&quot;Just some fresh air, nothing more&quot;, I mutter to myself as I walk outside the inn. It&#39;s been a few minutes since Nadia left. My eyes take a moment to adjust to the brighter scene before me. It looks like mid-afternoon. The street is busy. I see people passing by, a merchant selling expensive-seeming fabric, and children running through the streets playing games. The scene reminds me I haven&#39;t explored Tomb at all yet.

Where should I go? I can see the Death Goddess&#39;s palace at the center of the city, but I could head out to the edges of the city to just explore.

It might be more fun to walk towards the Palace. It seems to be the busiest part of the city.

***

The city does in fact get much busier as I walk towards the center. I can&#39;t count how many times I accidentally bumped into people on my way to the center because its so crowded. 

&quot;Charm necklaces! Blessed directly by her majesty! We&#39;re offering them for just one gold piece each!&quot;

&quot;Get yerself and yer family sum freshly killed mutton! Celebrate a New Year properly with a feast!&quot;

New Year? What calendar are they on? I guess they consider the Rite of Prophecy to be the mark of a new year. Grimstone and I consider the longest day of the year the beginning of a new year, just like in Alexandria. But here it seems they mark it on this rite.

I wade through the crowd. I hold back the urge to cry out in pain every time someone elbows me or walks into my shoulders. 

I reach out and feel a stone wall made of fine rock, mined from near a volcano. The wall is carved with artful depictions of the Death Goddess and past Crusaders, from what I can tell. The name of this wall comes to mind, &quot;The Wall of Heros.&quot;

I lie against the wall and take a deep breath. 
&lt;i&gt;
Perhaps I should have stayed in the inn. 
It&#39;s whatever.
I&#39;ll just catch my breath here for a bit...
&lt;/i&gt;

My mind drifts between conciousness and unconciousness.
I hear conversations pass by. My headache makes it hard to pay full attention.

&quot;Oh? This is ***- Tombsword, are you sure it&#39;s not an ******- in the form of a ***?&quot;
&quot;My, he&#39;s rather... common.&quot;

&quot;Silence! It is the will of the Death ******--! How darest thee! My carvings care not about ***-- nor-&quot;

&quot;Yes yes ***-, continue your work like your *** always do. I&#39;d warn you about ******- out of space on the ***-, but I doubt this ***- will accomplish anything! Ohoho-!&quot;
&quot;Why I oughta-&quot;

&quot;*** there! Away from the worker! He has been contracted on the will of Her Majesty!&quot;

&quot;Gah, curses- I&#39;ll be leaving- DON&#39;T TOUCH THE *** OF MY COAT YOU ***!...ugh... How far has the ****** fallen. Leaving ******- of all sorts now to the ****** folk-WAH&quot;

I feel something hit my leg. I drift back to conciousness. A man dressed finely in a dark brown fur coat picks himself off the ground, looking at me, then the guard walking him away at the tip of a spear, before stomping off in anger. 

&quot;You there, on the ground.&quot;
The guard speaks to me.
&quot;Careful, had it been any guard from the upper crust, and he would have had you locked away just for being in the way. Keep your wits about you, yeah?&quot;

He reaches a hand towards me. I lift myself up, toss him a coin, and walk off. 

I decide I should return to the inn. I see the people swarm around the walls, merchants attempting to grab the attention of the passerby, clerics of the Death Goddess placing offerings at the gates. The area here is even more dense. I barely manage to make it to an alley off the side of one the restaraunts. It is a dead-end, however.

&quot;Hehehe~ hello there boy.&quot;

A young and feminine voice makes itself known. Which way was out? Right. The way I came in. Goodbye potential pickpocket, I wish you the best in all your-

&quot;WAIT. DO YOU NOT DESIRE INFORMATION?&quot;

She knows my weakness. I do love trivia, unfourtunately I&#39;m rather disciplined and enjoy not having to fight suspicious strangers in an alleyway. I pick up the pace.

&quot;HUH? WAIT SLOW DOWN, ITS ABOUT A MERCHANT STALL. THE BEST PLACE IN TOWN TO SET ONE UP!&quot;, I hear her take a few steps forward. I briefly make out a delicate hand reaching from the large sleeves of a coat as it emerges from the shadows, before briefly pulling back from the light.

Rather odd bit of trivia, now why would I need to place a merchant stall anywhere-

WAIT.
&quot;WAIT. HOW DO YOU-&quot;

&quot;Oh thank goodness you stopped- I MEAN OHOHO! YOU DAREST ASK THE GREAT KNOWER OF THINGS! Well I suppose I could share a tidbit or two for a foreigner in a strange land.&quot;

&quot;Knower of things? You don&#39;t seem to know how to pick a good name. Are you sure you&#39;re not the foreigner? I thought that was a social defect found only in the Vitus Theocracy?&quot;

&quot;HEY LISTEN I WAS IN A RUSH YOU BRAT! DON&#39;T LECTURE ME WHEN I CAME ALL THe way here- I mean,&quot; this was not the same voice a moment ago. Well, she lost her composure. Big time. Superior Foreigner 1, Suspicious Foreigner 0. Pff, who needs home turf, amirite? &quot;Take your time, I&#39;ll be waiting for you to continue your little act, Ms.Knower of Things&quot;, I lean against the wall of the alley, relishing the moment. 

&quot;No! I won&#39;t tell you. I&#39;d rather just...&quot;, her voice trails off into the alleyway. She does know that it is a dead end...right?

&quot;What? Wait wait, you don&#39;t just claim to have useful information then storm off in a tantrum! That&#39;s poor ethics!&quot;

&quot;Didn&#39;t ask, don&#39;t care! Go annoy someone else you damn matchstick...I try and have some fun on my day off and this is what I&#39;m met with...&quot;

&quot;Wait! I really need this information. Please! I&#39;ll go along with the act&quot;, look at me..asking nicely? Bleh. But if she&#39;s legit...this might be my one shot. I bolt down the alley, I make out the form of someone in a cloak. A hooked staff in one arm. 

&quot;Hey what&#39;re you- wait don&#39;t come over here! Stay back dammit!&quot;, she pulls her hood over her hair and swings the crook around wildly. I don&#39;t have the endurance for this.

I guess I have to...

[[Grovel]]

[[Leave her alone]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="To the outskirts of Tomb" tags="Done" position="450,975" size="100,100">I&#39;m feeling a little adventurous. Let&#39;s go towards the edges of the city.
***
The outskirts of Tomb are sacred grounds(at least I&#39;d guess so). There are many hundreds, perhaps thousands, of graves encircling the city. Everywhere you look there are people leaving flowers and candles at tombstones. I remember reading somewhere that for those who died who no longer have graves that are attended, the people of the nation visit the graves of as a way to find favor with the gods. 

I find the gravesite of the Necron house. It appears as if the graves of the commoners and nobility aren&#39;t that far apart. This is a far cry from the Ionian Republic or Alexandria. The designs on each tombstone are quite different. The Necron Coat of Arms is visible on each tombstone: a hand holding a Shepherd&#39;s Crook giving it to a cloaked hand reaching down from above. Their whole family&#39;s identity really has been shaped by that one event, hasn&#39;t it?

I continue my exploration of the gravesites. I see some areas whose environments are quite out of place. Sands, mounds of earth, rolling plains, and even snow? These appear to be gravesites for foreigners. Probably made for those who wish to be buried in something resembling their ancestral home. 

I approach the graves for members of a smithing guild, and there is a figure who immediately catches my attention. A man who was &quot;sturdily built&quot; is cleaning the carved stone swords etched into each of the members&#39; graves, he&#39;s quite tall. His cloak extends over his right arm, the hem being rather tattered. 

He looks at me. 

&lt;i&gt;Oh boy. Awkward. I will be on my way now.&lt;/i&gt;

I see a mother and her daughter pass by me as I walk away. The daughter points to the man. The mother scolds her daughter, saying something about a &quot;cursed family.&quot; It&#39;s none of my business anyways.

***
&quot;Done paying your respects?&quot;

&quot;N-Nadia!?&quot;, I cry out in surprise as she stands with her arms crossed at the edge of the gravesite.

&quot;As much as I would have wanted to pluck you out of the Great Cemetary, I felt morally obliged to leave you until you felt satisfied. Are you done now?&quot;

Her tone is rather harsh. No joking this time around. Else I might not go back to the Inn with my arms still attached.

&quot;Yeah. I&#39;m done here.&quot;

And so we return back to the Inn in silence for most of the walk.

***

Enough time has gone by such that Nadia was able to remove all of the bandages. I can move my arms perfectly fine now. Spells are still somewhat doable, but Nadia got mad when I tried testing it. 

It is an hour before sunset. 

&quot;I&#39;m hoooommeee!&quot;, Grimstone&#39;s sing-songingly says as he marches into the room, &quot;That was a productive day.&quot;

&quot;Welcome back, Master Grimstone.&quot;
&quot;Thank you for your work Nadia you may leave, give Darius my thanks!&quot;
&quot;Of course Master Grimstone&quot;, Nadia bows and politely leaves. 

&quot;Well you seem like you&#39;re in a good mood.&quot;

&quot;But of course, I found the perfect spot.&quot;

&quot;Oh really, and how did-&quot;

&quot;Anyways,&quot; he cuts me off, &quot;It&#39;s already set up. Just be sure to rest well. I&#39;ll leave early tomorrow to make all the final preparations.&quot;

&quot;Oh, nice...nice...&quot;

&quot;Hm? What&#39;s the matter with you, Clay? You look like someone ate the last glazed cream bun on your plate.&quot;

&quot;Dunno&quot;, I shrug. I just feel a little removed from everything. I mean I had an excuse, but everything else just kept happening around me. Grimstone got everything done. I mean that&#39;s great and all but I can&#39;t help but feel...

&quot;AH! I GOT IT!&quot;, Grimstone shouts

&quot;Huh?&quot;

&quot;Lets go get you some glazed cream buns!&quot;

&quot;Quite the literal solution, don&#39;t you think?&quot;

&quot;And a delicious one too! C&#39;mon! c&#39;mon!&quot;, Grimstone says as he grabs his pouch and runs out the door.

&quot;You better not get ripped off again!&quot;, I stumble out of the bed and chase him.

***

&quot;Can&#39;t believe it...you spent 5 silvers on TWO cream buns? They weren&#39;t even glazed!&quot;

&quot;Actually I spent 7 silvers on THREE!&quot;, Grimstone proudly holds another cream bun in the air. A raven goes and snatches it out of his hands, &quot;Oh...WAIT A MOMENT!&quot;, he stuffs his current cream bun into his mouth and chases after the raven. 

To recap, me and Grimstone went from stall to stall but they were all saving their remaining stock to serve in the morning. One stall was kind enough to let us have some, but Grimstone left a hefty tip for the seller. Kind but very irresponsible.

So here we are. A teacher and disciple on the streets of Tomb. One is eating his Cream Bun, the other is fighting the forces of nature for his food...you&#39;d be surprised at which is which. I&#39;m sure not.

Grimstone manages to grab the bird and wrench the bun out of its claws. He dusts it off and splits it, &quot;Want some?&quot;

&quot;As much as the dirt from the claws of a bird make for excellet seasoning, I&#39;m on a diet from all things disgusting.&quot;

&quot;Suit yourself,&quot; he starts eating the bun without issue. I truly can&#39;t fathom this man.

We&#39;re taking a stroll through the city now. It&#39;s about sunset, &quot;Hey Grim?&quot;, I kick a pebble at him.

&quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;How do you never let anything bother you?&quot;

&quot;What do you mean?&quot;

&quot;The bird stealing your bun,the struggle to find a stall,the fact I became dead weight all day, our debt?&quot;

&quot;Well. I mean...&quot;, he shrugs, &quot;Maybe I&#39;m just dumb?&quot;, he kicks it back.

&quot;&#39;Maybe&#39; my ass, it&#39;s bloody well obvious you have the common sense of a pinecone.&quot;, I kick it off to the side, &quot;But even you surely have worries?&quot;

He blocks the path of the stone with the side of his foot, &quot;I do. I worry about food, safety, and especially money, I am human after all.&quot;, he uses a little earth magic to propel the stone straight up,&quot;But stressing about these things won&#39;t fix them, will they?&quot;, he kicks the pebble at me.

&quot;Of course I know that, but even so- OW!&quot;, I tried to headbutt the pebble, forgetting it is a solid object moving at high speed. I fell straight onto my back, &quot;- worries don&#39;t just vanish like that. Yet for you they&#39;re entirely absent. Why?&quot;

&quot;Well, it&#39;s not something as simple as a switch you can flip in your mind, Clay.&quot; He walks over to me, &quot;You will find that state eventually. For now just worry about making it through the day, tomorrow will worry about itself.&quot; Grimstone extends a hand to me and I grab it and get back up. We continue our little improv game with this rock.

Spoiler. Grimstone won.

***

We head back to the Inn, exhaused. Grim uses their bath and then I do. We head to sleep. I dream of rocks of all kinds. I decided to stop chasing the shinier ones, and instead to stick with the one I have now.

[[And The Rite of Prophecy Begins...]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="We finish shoveling..." tags="Done" position="400,200" size="100,100">After clearing out a walkable area around our garden and the porch of our cabin, we finally went back inside to discuss our financial situation.

&quot;So Clay, have you made the preparations?&quot;

&quot;What? I told you I did three days ago. Our bags are already packed, we just need to see if any carriage drivers are going in the direction of Crowfallen. We can probably hitch a ride with a merchant caravan if we hire ourselves out as mercenaries, I checked for a few listings in the vilage.&quot;

&quot;Good. Now, let&#39;s see...&quot;

Grimstone gets up out of his rocking chair and goes to the floorboard under the carpet, pulling out a satchel.

&quot;You&#39;re going for the junk merchandise?&quot;

&quot;Mind your words. It&#39;s not &#39;junk&#39;, it&#39;s &#39;reserves&#39;. I kept these old things in case we needed to sell them. Seems like the optimal time for it.&quot;

&quot;Of course, though, will people want any of it?&quot;

&quot;Of course they will, take a look at this...&quot;

He pulls out a green gem from within. 

&quot;This one right here lets you light a fire easily.&quot;

&quot;Can&#39;t you do that for free with two rocks from the ground?&quot;

He mutters something and pulls out another gem, this time yellow.

&quot;This gem is extremely hard, perfect for a chisel.&quot;

&quot;Well can you make it into a chisel itself?&quot;

&quot;Of course you can make it into a-&quot;

The Old Man thinks it over some more.

&quot;Not without any major difficulty.&quot;

I look at his bag, then at him, trying to convince myself people would actually buy any of this.

&quot;I assure you, this trip will be fruitful in more ways than one.&quot;

Grimstone says this with a strangely optimistic tone.

We continue to discuss the details of the trip, and before we know it, it&#39;s almost nighttime. We had already made preparations for the road a day ago, so it was simply a matter of making sure nobody breaks in while we&#39;re away. We stand outside The Shack as Grim turns to me and asks, &quot;Clay, do you know the incantation?&quot;

&quot;Well yeah, you taught me it earlier.&quot;

I reach for my staff and imagine the runes carved in it as an extension of my arm&#39;s veins. The runes begin to glow a faint blue.

&lt;i&gt;&quot;Illusions and reality are of the same substance. That which is real is mere illusions...That which is an illusion is of reality...Become like nothing. Vanish. Be destroyed. Be vacant. Be hollow. Be enveloped in the `&lt;Shroud of Illusion&gt;`!&quot;&lt;/i&gt;

The form of the Old Man&#39;s Shack begins to twist and blur into the surroundings, before completely vanishing.

I look at where the shack is hidden before returning my gaze to the old man. I held myself proudly, ready to be praised for a job well do-

&quot;You took too long.&quot;

&quot;Hey! Have you ever seen ME complain when you take half a year to choose what to buy in the market?&quot;

Thus, we set out on our merry way.


***

After about 3 days, we&#39;ve made our way to the Tombstone Mountains, and are now trekking towards the Serpent Valley. Another day of walking until we arrive.

Luckily, a few merchants agreed to hire us in exchange for free transport to the city. All the other adventurers were hired out already, so they&#39;re stuck with just us.

&quot;Behind you, Clay!&quot;

I whirl around and take a step back as a pointed mass of earth shot its way up from the ground, shattering the Skeleton that managed to reach my blind spot.

&quot;I could have handled that, Old Ma-AH!&quot;

I duck and roll, barely dodging the club that one particularly large Skeleton is holding.

&quot;What is that thing made of? Nothing humanoid can be that big!&quot;

I realized why as I took a closer look. The &quot;bones&quot; making up its body were themselves made of smaller bones of many other creatures.  It looked like a Skeleton made of Skeletons. It leaves me no room to note its structure as it takes another swing at me. 

Instantly, I grip my staff with both arms and hold it above me.

*CRACK!*

The wooden club slams into my staff, rendering my arms numb. My field of vision shakes from the impact. 

&lt;i&gt;I have to escape!&lt;/i&gt;

&quot;&lt;i&gt;`&lt;Shockwave!&gt;`&lt;/i&gt;&quot;

***BOOM***

The world around me spins as I&#39;m sent backward, my body is tossed against the ground as I roll for what felt like an eternity. My ears are ringing. I finally land face down, weakly looking up and at the Skeleton. I put around 20 meters between us. It, however, just recovered, and does not seem happy. 

&lt;i&gt;Is this it? Do I die like this? I haven&#39;t even become rich yet! Well... I&#39;ll certainly see the Death Goddess now, I guess. &lt;/i&gt;

I feel a tremor, a sudden white pulse fills my field of view. I squint my eyes and see the giant Skeleton....No, pieces of it, flying in all directions. In the place of the monster was Grimstone.

My body feels heavy, and I stumble back a bit as I rise. The ground feels like it&#39;s rolling beneath my feet. The sun feels too bright.

&quot;Well, what have you learned?&quot;, he asks.

&quot;Other than the taste of dirt? Not much.&quot;

&quot;Good. Know the taste of dirt, become accustomed to it. Anyone who wishes to become anything in life must know and love the taste of dirt because only after tasting it can one rise up stronger.&quot;

&quot;I know you say my cooking is bad, but now&#39;s not the time&quot;, I respond, rolling my eyes. A poor choice, truly, as I am still dizzy. I nearly fall.

&quot;As I always say, Clay&quot;, he yanks the back of my hood back to keep me from falling any further,&quot;there is always a bit of &#39;you&#39; in every dish you make.&quot;

&quot;Yes yes well until you hire a maid, enjoy the taste of dirt.&quot;

After tending to our (my) wounds, we pick up our belongings and march onwards. The weather so far has been calm, sunny, not a cloud in sight. It feels comical considering we are going to the Death Goddess&#39;s domain, Crowgarden. Her kingdom is often associated with despair, as death typically is. Albeit, people are coming to her in a few days with major hopes for the future, perhaps the weather understands that. Though I wonder, why does the Death Goddess have the ability to see the future? I feel like I remember hearing it in a story once.

&quot;Yo Grim, what was the story you once told me about how the Death Goddess gained her future-sight?&quot;

He turns to me, &quot;&#39;Yo&#39;? &#39;Grim&#39;? I thought you lost that verbal tick of yours years ago.&quot;

&quot;With all do respect, please shut up.&quot;

He shakes his head, chuckling, &quot;As for that story...hmm.... you should have it in that book of yours.&quot;

&quot;What? Too lazy to tell me?&quot;

&quot;I suppose you could say that.&quot;

We continue our chatting as usual. And before we knew it. We arrived at Tomb, the center of the Death Goddess&#39;s Kingdom.

### Tomb

We finally arrive. The merchants were hurling promises of upcoming discounts, limited time spices, and rare jewlery. There were people stringing banners between lamp posts, each displaying a year and a depiction of the Goddess&#39;s prophecy: presumably having come true.
People were placing images of their loved ones at their windowsills, adorned with flowers and candles. The walkways were covered in hurried drawings of the Death Goddess made by children. Many of them depict her leading them, protecting them, and even playing with them.

&quot;WATCH OUT!&quot;

Startled, I leap backwards. A horse pulling a wagon races past me, two kids straddled on its back. The Tomb Knights, wearing brown and black cloaks, gave chase. For a city called the Tomb, it was quite lively.

After securing a room at an inn, I toss my bag against the wall and flop onto the bed, it&#39;s around sundown.

&quot;FINALLY. You never appreciate real beds till after a trip.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t get too comfortable Clay, else you won&#39;t wake up tomorrow&quot;, the Old Man says, opening the curtains, orange light fills the room from the orange sunset.

&quot;Ugh....&quot;, I roll in bed, as if having just woken up.

&quot;It&#39;s an important day tomorrow, if we don&#39;t act fast other merchants will take the best spots&quot;, the old man sorts out the items in his bag, taking out a wooden sign that reads &quot;GRIMSTONE&#39;S STONES.&quot;

&quot;That sign is still horrible, we need a new name.&quot;

&quot;Non-negotiable.&quot;

&quot;I know it&#39;s non-negotiable, you&#39;ve said it countless times, and I&#39;ll keep saying that we need a new name.&quot;

He shakes his head and leaves the sign leaning against the nightstand. Snapping, he makes a small flame and lights the candle on the stand. He pulls out his diary and starts writing, as he usually does every night.

I grab a book from my satchel, it&#39;s a book of assorted legends from all over the land. I flip around till I find some from Crowfallen, and start reading.

After a few hours, Grimstone blows out the candle and tucks himself in. I place my book on the nightstand and stare out the window at the night sky. The legend of the Moon God came to mind as a I saw the crescent moon. They say that the Moon&#39;s shape is always chosen by the Moon God at night.

&quot;Clay?&quot;

&quot;What?&#39;

&quot;Go to sleep.&quot;

&quot;How&#39;d you know I was awake?&quot;

&quot;Your breathing.&quot;

&quot;I guess I&#39;ll stop breathing then.&quot;

&quot;Good luck&quot;, Grimstone mutters, turning over in his bed.

Staring out into the darkroom, my eyes grow tired. Slumber overcomes me.

### Preparations

Two days till the event.

&quot;Yo.&quot;

&quot;......&quot;

&quot;Yo Old Man.&quot;

&quot;......&quot;

&quot;Wake up.&quot;

&quot;......&quot;

&quot;Someone wants to buy-&quot;

&quot;I HAVE AWAKENED!&quot;

I tumble backward, just barely dodging the Old Man&#39;s forehead as it suddenly shot up.

&quot;Greedy as ever, lovely.&quot;

&quot;Is it okay to come in?&quot;, our buyer says, &quot;I don&#39;t want to impose if he&#39;s asleep.&quot;

&quot;No no, he&#39;s as lively as he possibly can be.&quot;

A man wearing a black and brown cloak over his shoulders, similar to that of the Tomb Knights, walks in. Grimstone tilted his head smiling, &quot;Ah, well if it isn&#39;t Lord Necron?&quot;

The man scratched the side of his face, &quot;Please, call me Darius, Grimstone.&quot;

&quot;Well then, Darius, what brings you here?&quot;

&quot;I just so happened to catch word of a certain Alchemist having entered the capital, right when we needed him most.&quot;

&quot;Oh? What will it be this time? Has the Necron Family been unable to find another crucial gem for The Offering?&quot;

&quot;Please don&#39;t tease us....but yes, we have been unable to secure a proper Serpent Diamond. It should be worth 2,000 Gold Skulls.&quot;

&quot;2,000 Gold Skulls? That&#39;s a hefty ask. Are you able to pay?&quot;

My eyes and ears perk up at hearing the amount &quot;2,000&quot; and the word &quot;Gold&quot; in the same sentence.

&quot;But of course. We&#39;ve been able to pay every time before, haven&#39;t we?&quot;

&quot;That is true. But isn&#39;t this over a hundred times the normal amount? What makes this year so special?&quot;

&quot;This year is the 2,000th anniversary of the Crusades, and for this year&#39;s Prophecy, they&#39;re announcing her Crusader. This Rite is much more important than the last ones.&quot;

&quot;The Death Goddess&#39;s Crusader you say...have you met him?&quot;

&quot;No, apparently she&#39;s keeping it a secret until the announcement. Rumors are saying, however, it&#39;s a blacksmith.&quot;

&quot;A blacksmith as a Crusader?&quot;

&quot;Indeed. Our Goddess&#39;s ways are often beyond our comprehension.&quot;

I could have sworn Grimstone muttered something offensive under his breath before saying, &quot;Back to the topic at hand, do you know where we could source the gem from?&quot;

&quot;The Old Mines right at the end of the Serpent Valley.&quot;

Ah, so we are exploring a mineshaft now. Fantastic. Totally in-line with our plans to sell gems.

Grimstone shakes his head, &quot;Making a poor old man in his old age go down into dangerous mines. Really Darius, have you no shame?&quot;

Lord Necron smirks, &quot;Surely if you considered yourself a poor old man, you wouldn&#39;t have secured transport by offering yourself as swords for hire, correct?&quot;

&quot;Ha! Observant as ever, aren&#39;t you?!&quot;, Grimstone&#39;s chuckling fills the room.

&quot;I have my ways...Well, do you accept?&quot;

&quot;Guess I have no choice, Clay?&quot;

Leaned against a wall, I raise my hand a bit, &quot;Ready when you are.&quot;

&quot;Brilliant,&quot; Lord Necron says, &quot;I will have the payment immediately available once the gem is retrieved.&quot;

A realization strikes me square in the face, &quot;I guess I should go stock up on supplies, huh? I can&#39;t help but think how much we are going to spend on supplies and might not even find the accrused rock.&quot;

&quot;No need,&quot; Lord Necron cuts in,&quot;I had already made arrangements. Nadia-!&quot;

&quot;At your command, Lord Necron,&quot; a woman dressed in a black hood enters. She has the appearance of a mercenary, but the demeanor of a servant. She heaves a large bag onto my bed, and opens it to reveal an assortment of potions, matches, and dried foodstuffs. &quot;This should suffice, no?&quot;, the servant says while looking up at Lord Necron.

&quot;Yes, that will do,&quot; he says. 

And with that, our mission begins.


***

I look down into the cave, and it feels like it looks back at me. The dead torch at its mouth and the worn pickaxes near it make the scene feel dead.

&quot;And away we go!&quot;
The old man says, suddenly flying past me. At least he&#39;s lively.

I channel energy into my legs and leap into the mines. My vision is encased in darkness, but luckily I have a general sense of what&#39;s around me. I wouldn&#39;t be the disciple of a blind warrior if I relied on sight all the- 
&quot;CLAY!&quot;
My body goes numb. The pain is terrible. I think I broke multiple bones. I lost my bearing. It hurts. 

I lie prone on the cave floor, I sense something in front of me.
I...

[[...draw my sword and strike]]
[[...wait.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="And The Rite of Prophecy Begins..." tags="Done" position="200,1025" size="100,100">Sun hits me straight in the face as I wake up. Grimstone had already head out. I can hear the festivities, and even smell it, from my bed. People are out in the streets playing music, children run through the crowds playing games and giving gifts, and people are going in droves to the Cemetaries seemingly for memorials. From what I remember the Rite itself should only start 3 hours past sunrise, giving me enough time to get ready and get to our stall. 

I slide out of bed and begin changing.
***

&quot;Excuse me!- Ah, Sorry!- I just need to get by-&quot;, I slip through the crowd. To think it would get even MORE dense than what I saw when I woke up. I&#39;m almost at our stall-

&quot;Yes that&#39;s 3 silvers- we can wrap this ye- Oh you would like a larger variety, those sold out- We can do custom orders, take this note here and- OH CLAY THANK THE HEAVENS&quot;, I arrive to see our stall being swarmed by customers. Grimstone is hardly holding out. Honestly its almost like he struggles here more than when he did against that strange woman in the street, or even the Crystal Dragon.

And so Grimstone has me working nonstop: taking orders, switching with him as we start on custom-made items, explaining various types of gems and jewels. An hour goes by in minutes.

Trumpets blare. Most everyone here starts looking up at the parapet of Tomb&#39;s palace.

&quot;Let all ears attend! Her Divine Majesty, the Death Goddess Morrigan, will now commence the Rite of Prophecy.&quot;

Some people seem to still want to buy items in the midst of the event. Luckily things have slowed down considerably since everyone is very keen on listening. 

&quot;My beloved subjects,&quot; a young voice fills the air of the city, &quot;this day marks the 2,000th year that our glorious kingdom has been blessed to bear witness to what the months ahead of us have in store for us.&quot;

&lt;IF MetLugh = 1:&quot;Her voice is sweet yet something about it greatly irritates me. I can&#39;t quite make sense of it&quot;&gt;

&quot;From our Kingdom&#39;s inception, I&#39;ve prided myself in being as deeply connected with our people as possible. Each one of you carries the title of being my subject, from the greatest of heroes to the smallest of children. As with each Rite, we commemorate the heroes who came before your generation. Let us listen once more the tale of the house Necron&#39;s founder.&quot;

There is a brief silence before a far more familiar voice speaks, &quot;As many of you may know, I am Darius Necron, 2570th head of the Necron Family. It is my duty and honor to retell the story of our ancestor...&quot;

And so Darius retells the story. Their founder&#39;s name was Kairos, and he had searched the whole world to return the staff Necron to Morrigan, who had lost it whilst defeating the monster known as Ceris the Plaguewalker.

The story concludes and Darius presents the gift to the Goddess, &quot;My, what an exquisite gift. Is this what I think it is?&quot;, her reaction reverberates throughout the Kingdom.

&quot;Indeed, a Serpend Diamond necklace worth 2,000 Gold Skulls&quot;, the people react with shock and amazement. I see one woman ask her husband why he isn&#39;t getting her anything that nice. The husband has a dejected look on his face.

&quot;The Necron Family never fails to amaze me each year. You&#39;ve truly outdone yourself- Oh wait we still being broadcasted? Heh heh my bad~&quot;, something about her voice for a moment struck a bad chord with me, &quot;&lt;i&gt;ahem&lt;/i&gt;, and so with that let us continue with the next generation of heroes.

And so, one after another, the stories are told. Some by Morrigan, others by heads of various families. The whole ordeal takes quite a long time. It seems people have become accustomed to mostly drowning out this section because it&#39;s the same each year. The stall becomes increasingly busy.

&quot;CLAY WHERE ARE THOSE SPIRAL-CUT FROST EMERALDS!&quot;

&quot;WORKING ON IT! JUST KEEP TAKING ORDERS.&quot;

Not even a second for a break. If one of us needed to eat...well...they(I) need to toughen up. It doesn&#39;t help that from where I&#39;m sitting I can see people bringing food from other stalls.

&quot;...and so with this we shall commence the Prophecy.&quot;

People return to mostly being silent. The Goddess begins to raise her arms. Ravens begin flying in an sphere above the Palace. It soon turns to a mass of darkness. &quot;&lt;b&gt; The farmers shall reap much over this summer. There shall be prosperity amongst the merchants...&lt;/b&gt;&quot;, she says...the Orb turns into a depiciton of a bountiful field.

&quot;Hey sorry can I get that gem in the back?&quot;

&quot;Of course let me grab that.&quot;

&quot;&lt;b&gt;...The adventurers shall soon discover ruins which tell of legends that are unknown even to the Widsom Goddess....&lt;/b&gt;&quot;, the fields turn into the halls of what appears to be an ancient labrynth.

I hear an joyous uproar among the adventurers.

&quot;&lt;b&gt;...the knights shall face a powerful force...&lt;/b&gt;&quot;

&quot;Are you still selling the Silent Wind Quartz?&quot;

&quot;Unfortunately those sold out.&quot;

&quot;&lt;b&gt;...and as for the Crusade...we shalll...we...wait&lt;/b&gt;&quot;, silence falls across the city. Now everyone has ther focus on the Goddess. Everyone seems perplexed. The labrynth morphs back into an orb.

&quot;&lt;b&gt;....I...I can&#39;t see anything...I can&#39;t see...I can&#39;t-&lt;/b&gt;&quot;, the orb dissolves and the ravens forming it fly away in all directions. Some fly down and steal the food of passerby. Grimstone stops what he&#39;s doing and takes a look at the palace from where he is.

&quot;Lady Morrigan! Are you okay!&quot;, we hear the voice of one of her attendants be broadcasted as well. There appears to be a commotion atop the Palace. People down here are getting restless as well.

After a brief moment, Darius&#39;s voice is heard, &quot;Be at ease, everyone. It is nothing major, the Goddess seems to have overworked herself. She will be resting for some time. Until then, please enjoy the festival. It is her fervent wish that none of your days are ruined because of this&quot;, everyone graudally returns to the swing of things. There are people whispering about an assasination plot, or perhaps old age.

&quot;We are closed. We hope to see you all next year&quot;, Grimstone says out of nowhere. He takes down the sign and starts packing away our belongings. The crowd, confused, starts to disperse to other stalls.

&quot;Grim!? What the- Why are we closing? Its not even evening!&quot;

&quot;Enough, Clay. I have my reasons.&quot;

Without so much as a word, we pack up and close the stall. 

***
Back at the Inn, I try asking again. 

&quot;Grim please. Is there something you could tell me, why did we close so early? This isn&#39;t like you.&quot;

&quot;There are more important things to do, that is all.&quot;

&quot;Oh really&quot;

&quot;Just start packing up. We&#39;re heading back home.&quot;

I reluctantly agree.

[[Chapter II-Call to the Crusade]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="Meet with Grimstone" tags="Done" position="50,725" size="100,100">Eventually I make it back to the Inn. Grimstone is there and he&#39;s getting his clothes laid out for tomorrow.

&quot;Look at you being all productive? You must be excited,&quot; I say while doing the same.

&quot;I suppose,&quot; Grim says. He continues laying out and folding his usual outfit: a dark gray shirt with a light gray overcoat, and beige pants. Grim prides himself on being a minimalist. These are basically the only things he ever wears.

&quot;Hey Grim?&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;Tomorrow we&#39;re hearing that prophecy from the Death Goddess right?&quot;

&quot;Yes we are. That just so happens to be the whole reason this event exists. What of it?&quot;

&quot;Okay Captain Snark,&quot; I roll my eyes, &quot;I wanted to know what prophecy you expect.&quot;

&quot;Expect?&quot;

&quot;Yeah. I feel like you would hear whatever it is and be like &#39;Business as usual, back to being poor&#39; or something.&quot;

&quot;Back to being-&quot;, Grimstone started laughing before saying,&quot;...Oh man....Clay you&#39;re too much sometimes. As for expectations, part of me doubts she&#39;d be able to predict the weather tomorrow with any level of accuracy.&quot;

&quot;Wait really? Man how pessimistic can you be?&quot;, I tilt my head in foncusing,&quot;well if you were to wish for a particular prophecy to be announced, what would it be?&quot;

&quot;That you&#39;d finally stop copying me, firstly&quot;, he says while pointing at my bed: I&#39;ve copied his exacty layout. &quot;What was the old adage? Something about a monkey both seeing and doing?&quot;

&quot;Why I oughta...&quot;, I grab a shirt and throw it at him. He smacks it down, reaches for a shoe, and tosses it square into my nose.

&quot;OW!&quot;

By midnight, the room is a mess.

&quot;You shot first&quot;, he says.

&quot;Fancying an end to the armistice?&quot;, I reply, reaching for the shoe I&#39;m wearing.

&quot;No sir.&quot;

And so we begin cleaning. Grimstone tells me he&#39;ll leave early in the morning to get things sorted, and we both knock out for the night.

[[And The Rite of Prophecy Begins...]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="...wait." tags="Done" position="550,300" size="100,100">***Perhaps write some special interaction here***

My eyes feel like they have started to adjust to the darkness, and I make out the vague shape of a man with misshapen hair. 
&quot;Clay, I told you not to fly blind&quot;, I can hear him shaking his head from his voice. I feel him grab my arm and drag me up.

He casts healing spells on me, and all I can do is mutter, trying to think of something to say. I still haven&#39;t mastered fighting without sight as he can. I&#39;m not even a novice. Moving without sight is not even feasible for me. How am I supposed to advance? I&#39;m a capable fighter, but unless I can do what seems impossible, what&#39;s left?

&quot;Clay...&quot;, his voice bears down on me. 

Oh boy....I&#39;m in for it, aren&#39;t I....?

&quot;Y-yes?&quot;

&quot;No more using `&lt;Blind Leap&gt;`. Got it? It&#39;s still beyond your skill range.&quot;

&quot;B-...fine.&quot;

I can&#39;t seem to defend myself. Grimstone&#39;s techniques are still leagues ahead of mine. 

&quot;Hm...What an interesting Cave.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s so special about it?&quot;

&quot;The way it winds downwards and around, it seems to go on in circles and twisting, and it seems like it reaches the surface at another point here. The mine seems to really start at the lowest point.&quot;
&quot;Didn&#39;t Seraphus once fight Morrigan here? She could&#39;ve dug into the ground and formed the tunnels with her body while slithering through the rocks.&quot;

&quot;Perhaps...but if so....there seems to be an eerie lack of monsters here.&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s be thankful that there is an eerie lack of monsters.&quot;

After a few minutes, Grimstone pipes up, &quot;Well, I believe the lower levels of the mine should begin right here.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;re you talking about there&#39;s nothing there it&#39;s just more ro-&quot;

He takes his staff and props it against a boulder, pushing it aside effortlessly, revealing a stretch of tunnels that seem much more man-made. 

I&#39;m dumbfounded.

&quot;Clay, remember your breathing incantations. The air down here likely is not pure.&quot;

&quot;Yes yes...*Oh wind that breathes life to those who accept it, become as a veil to guard me against impurity. Let my words speak peace and my chest bear life. The wind holds with it the stories of our ancestors, the tales of heroism, of failure, of life, of death....&quot;*

The only sound that fills the cave are our footsteps, and the muttering of the near-endless incantation.

As we continue to walk through the cave, I notice the sparkling of some gems. These aren&#39;t useful gems, however. The most common crystal, Earth Mica, is flimsy yet has a distinct shine to it. It has no real use...speaking of useless...

&quot;Hey Grimstone?&quot;

&quot;Why do I feel like you&#39;re secretly mocking me?&quot;

Dammit, he saw right through me. Well he&#39;s blind so...heard through me? Sensed through me? Tasted through me? Smelled through me? I shrug, pointing at the stretch of tunnels before us, &quot;Mockery aside-&quot;

&quot;So you were-?&quot;,  he turns towards me suddenly.

I continue, &quot;-how much further do we need to go?&quot;

&quot;Tsk,&quot; he wacks his staff against the floor and waits a moment, &quot;about 30 steps this way&quot;, he takes a turn at a fork in the tunnel that I hadn&#39;t even noticed. I begin counting steps.

&quot;Here we are,&quot; he stretches his arms out, pointing towards something in the darkness up ahead.

&quot;-No reaction? Oh it must be dark then.&quot;

Right on the money. He creates a small flame at the end of his finger, then condenses it into a shining orb, increasing the intensity. Shielding my eyes from the light source itself, I begin to see red gems all across the ground and cave walls.

MONEY.

ALL I SEE IS MONEY.

WE WILL FINALLY BE OUT OF DEBT.

AND THIS IS ENOUGH TO LIVE IN LUXURY.

*rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh*

&quot;Grim was that you?&quot;

&quot;No...?&quot;

I feel a knot form in my chest, as I look towards the large cave chamber.

The area seems large and mostly vacant in the middle. There is a large mass of shifting stones there but nothing else.

Wait.

Shifting stones?

&quot;Grimstone is that aURHG-&quot;, something yanks me off to the side.

Where I was standing, a spike made of red crystal took its place, Grimstone pulled me away by my collar.

&quot;...Crystal dragon, and a strong one too, it seems.&quot;

The shifting mass of stones in the middle of the room begins to form into a ferocious lizard-like creature, with a face resembling a rhinoceros, but broader and more like a shield. The back is covered in spiked crystals, along with a swinging tail whose end is a dense mass of rock with spikes of the same kind. The front of this creature seems to be adorned in crystalline armor.

Grimstone thinks it over, &quot;If there&#39;s a Crystal Dragon here, that means that the crystals here are all the unusable...except...&quot;

I gesture towards him to continue, I don&#39;t want to cut off my breathing incantation.

&quot;The dragon&#39;s horn, on its nose. The only crystal that won&#39;t cause any real harm to anything...aside from us if it hits us.&quot;

We should...

[[We have to go on the offensive]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="14" name="It&#39;s a threat" tags="Done" position="1575,250" size="100,100">stoneRusher: true
--
It has to be a threat.

I reach for my bag, in it is a scroll Grimstone and I had created as an experiment. I unroll the scroll and place a small gemstone in the middle of it. I power the scroll and suddently the gemstone distorts and expands into a hefty chunk of stone. It&#39;s not exactly stable, however. At the very least the stone should last 5 minutes before it starts to crumble into pure magical energy.

More than enough time, really.

I reach my right hand at the chunk and project the image of a large glove through my hand into the stone. The stone shifts around without resistance. I reach further: right sleeve, shirt, helmet, left sleeve, left glove. By the time I finish, I&#39;ve successfully covered the top half of my body in a layer of stone, it shifts and moves with my movements. My vision however is mostly broken into small vertical slits.

No time. I hear the enemy at the window trying to get in.

I begin casting a second spell.

&lt;i&gt;&quot;As bulls which trample the earth...&quot;&lt;/i&gt;

There is a &lt;i&gt;click&lt;/i&gt; at the window.

&lt;i&gt;&quot;...and as winds which ravage the skies....&quot;&lt;/i&gt;

The window starts to open, a hand reaches through.

&lt;i&gt;&quot;...STAMPEDE....&quot;&lt;/i&gt;

I feel a thin veil of magic cover me, and my entire body feels like a vase with lightning is trapped within it. Fixated on my target, I imagine the vase being suddenly opened.

&lt;i&gt;CRASH&lt;/i&gt;

In an instant, I&#39;m launched at my enemy. My stone, encased arm grabs him by his face. I toss him to the ground as I fall. He hits the ground with a thud.

I crash down beside him, grabbing his hands. I instantly shift the stone on my makeshift battle armor over his hands and merge it with the sand, hardening it. A moment of struggle and he goes slack. Target neutralized

&quot;Well, that was easy.&quot;

I lie down on the sandy ground. The desert night sky is a sight to behold.

&lt;i&gt; RIGHT! INTERROGATION! I&#39;M SUPPOSED TO DO THAT!..right? &lt;/i&gt;

I sit up and look at my attacker.

&lt;i&gt; &quot;Any sudden moves and you&#39;re dead, brat.&quot; &lt;/i&gt;

My attacker says. Wait, no. This voice is from behind me....A feminine voice. I feel a line of ice cold metal across my neck. Something tells me that I can&#39;t even cast a defensive earth spell before she slits my throat. I feel a bead of sweat run down my face.

&lt;i&gt;I&#39;m too young to die!... Calm down.... Calm down....&lt;/i&gt;

I look at my first attacker. He is still pinned down. He seems to be sweating too. His hood has slid down and his hair is in full view.

Wait...not his hair...her hair...that is also a girl who attacked me the first time.

Also, she is not sweating. Those are tears coming out from under her mask. Her sniffling is starting to give it away.

Oh boy. Grimstone cannot know about this. He will literally kill me. Like actually.

&quot;You&#39;re lucky that you were invited by the Wisdom Goddess herself. I&#39;d rather leave you for dead right here and now, freaking bastard. Tomorrow morning a carriage is taking you to the Goddess&#39;s Temple. Try not to defile her majesty&#39;s abode with your boorish presence, damn pig-&quot;

In a swift motion, the knife goes from being at my neck to being flipped around. She bashes me in the head with the base of the handle. The world spins.

&lt;i&gt;Goodnight world, may I never deal with strange masked women or intruders past my bedtime again...&lt;/i&gt;
***
&quot;Uh sir?....Sir!?!&quot;

A voice interrupts my sleep. I turn over to try and ignore it. Unfortunately I inhale some sand off the ground and start choking.

Wait...Sand?

I cough out the sand from my throat and look around. I seem to have fallen asleep in the streets of Alexandria....strangely enough someone was kind enough to put a quilt on me. 

&quot;Aah sir are you okay!? I&#39;m sorry but I just am asking you to move over if you can. I am here on orders from The Temple to escort a Crusader Candidate from here to the Temple itself. Please kindly understand.&quot;

The person before me is a man in a white tunic and a turban. 

&quot;Crusader Candidate...you wouldn&#39;t be looking for a &#39;Clay&#39;, would you?&quot;

&quot;Yes sir? Do you know him or where he is? I tried knocking on his door but it appears he is not in his room.&quot;

&quot;I think that&#39;s because he&#39;s right here sleeping on the ground&quot;, I reach into my pouch and dig up the letter from The Temple. I hand him it and he reads it, wide-eyed.

&quot;W-Well! This is quite the development sir. I knew some among the candidates were quite disciplined, but you are truly a tier above the rest, sir...I am in awe.&quot;

&quot;Sure lets go with that,&quot; I get up and roll up the quilt. I dust the sand off my clothing and go towards the inn, letting the carriage driver know that I&#39;ll be back soon.

After changing and packing, I head down and enter the Carriage
***
[[To the temple by Carriage]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="15" name="I should just open the window and check" tags="Done" position="1975,150" size="100,100">I should just open the window and check, why am I overcomplicating this?

I tumble out of bed and toss open the windows. I look to the left and right and see nothing.

&lt;i&gt; &quot;...almost...there...wha!&quot; &lt;/i&gt;

I look down. There appears to be a masked woman trying to climb up the building. She looks at me, surprised. I look at her, doubly surprised.

What would Grimstone do in this situations?!

[[Help her up]]
[[Knock her off]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="16" name="Help her up" tags="Done" position="1975,350" size="100,100">Grimstone would probably stretch out a hand and say something silly like, &quot;I see you have forgotten that doors exist. No problem, care for some tea?&quot;

Not in a tea mood right now, but watching this is making me feel bad so I&#39;ll at least pull her up.

&quot;Hey!? Need a hand?&quot;, I reach down towards her. She looks up at me from behind her mask. She seems to hesitate, before grabbing my hand. I pull her into the room through the window.

&quot;So...care to explain why you chose the path of most resistance?&quot;

She says nothing.

&quot;Ahem....Miss?&quot;

&quot;Uh-&quot;, he tries to say something but stops herself. 

I can&#39;t help but cross my arms and sigh. Quite a situation. Let&#39;s try and piece it all together. 

So she&#39;s NOT a thief. Definitely not. No thief is this much of a...well...emotional featherweight.

Not an assassin, for reasons previously mentioned. 

So what could she be?

&quot;Uhm, I have a me-&quot;, she says.

&quot;AH YOU&#39;RE SPEAKING YES!&quot;, I cut her off by accidently getting too excited.

It seemed to have been too much for her. She jolted and is now visibly anxious.

&quot;Ah. Sorry&quot;, I avoid eye contact.

The silence hangs in the air like a punishment for my outburst.

Soon, she finally starts to speak again, but in more of a whisper, &quot;I have a message...from the temple.&quot;

I nod.

She continues,&quot;There is a carriage tomorrow coming to pick you up at sunrise. Don&#39;t miss it.&quot;

I nod.

She&#39;s silent.

Silence.

&quot;...Is that all?&quot;, I ask.

She nods.

Well. That was a waste of time. 

&quot;So....&quot;, I try and figure out what to do. She&#39;s just there. &lt;i&gt;Exisiting.&lt;/i&gt;

Or rather, it seems she&#39;s actually sleeping. She seems to have slumped over a little. It is late at night. I go through the closet the room has and find a spare blanket and toss it over her. I&#39;d try and give her a pillow but she seems perfectly happy leaning on the wall and sitting on the floor in that position. 

I walk over to my bed and sleep. 

***
I wake up. I look to the window. A sight to behold is before me, truly.

I see the intruder, who turned into an overnight guest, trying to crawl out of the window.

&quot;FOR THE SAKE OF THE GODS. USE THE DOORS WOULD YOU?!&quot;

***
After she leaves, I realize I never caught her name. It&#39;s whatever, what are the odds I&#39;ll run into her again.

Something about that thought is eerily forboding, but I disregard it immediately.

I pack up my things, run down the stairs, and meet my carriage driver.

[[To the temple by Carriage]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="17" name="To the temple by Carriage" tags="Done" position="1725,525" size="100,100">I toss my bag into the wagon before hopping in myself. He cracks the reins and the ox begins pulling the carriage along. 

&quot;So, uh, how long until we get there?&quot;, I say.

&quot;Oh not more than a few hours. Are you in a rush?&quot;

&quot;No not particularly... Honestly wouldn&#39;t have minded if it were a bit longer though. Part of me loathes the idea of being in this tournament.&quot;

&quot;Oh? Why is that sir?&quot;

&quot;Dunno. Maybe nerves, I guess.&quot;

&quot;Well, based on the description I was given of you, I think you&#39;ll be fine for the tournament.&quot;

&quot;And what description might that be?&quot;

He stays silent.

&quot;Fine, suit yourself.&quot;, I lean against the side of the carriage and look out the back. I see poeple moving about their days. Children are playing in the streets, and I see merchants beginning to move towards the trading center of the city: the Old Man&#39;s Bazaar. It&#39;s called that because of an old myth that the trading hub grew because of an old man who became filthy rich off of it, and has been under his control since. Certainly false though since he&#39;d be dead by now. It&#39;s been named as such for as long as people can remember.

As we move further along, the neighboring buildings start to become increasingly more luxurious, and I begin to make out academic buildings left and right. 

&quot;Mer-Hab&#39;s School of Fine Art&quot;

&quot;Archpriest Ahmesseker&#39;s School of Divine Wisdom&quot;

&quot;Sethenes&#39;s School of Blacksmithery&quot;

Some places seemed to be run by a person or by their family, while others look like massive institutions. I rememeber something about Sethenes being a legendary blacksmith here who once created a sword that was capable of injuring even the War God Polemos.

***

The sky is a bright orange, and the buildings kept passing me by. Eventually the carriage came to a stop. 

&quot;Sir! Great news for you, we have arrived at the Temple of Divine Wisdom!&quot;

I saw roughly 10 other carriages that were pulling in too. Looks like everyone has been arriving according to schedule. Quite an orderly bunch, aren&#39;t they?

&quot;WHAT IN THE COBRA DEMON&#39;S TAIL DO YOU MEAN &#39;SoRry wE No loNgEr hAve aNy solO roOms&#39;. WHAT KINDA PEASANT DO YA TAKE ME FOR? WHAT JUST CUZ A FEW OF THESE DAMN PLEBIANS WITH SWORDS AND A FEW SPELLS COME IN, YOU DISREGARD THE RA&#39;ASHTARI NOBILITY? IS THIS SOME KIND OF JOKE?-&quot;

Spoke too soon. I hop out of the carriage and walk down the pathway leading into the Temple. The temple itself was a brilliant ivory construction. The entire thing almost resembled the Pyramids, but not quite. The acutal layout of the area seemed to be composed of 7 smaller buildings which had massive arching domes. Atop the domes were different symbols. The middle dome had a triangular window, and one could make out the beautiful design of the first of the Wisdom Goddess&#39;s 3 Veils.

I reach the rightmost building. The attendent there is pleading with a large surly fellow wearing a cloak. 

&quot;Please I am being as honest as one can be about this. Our orders were the solo rooms are first-come first-serve. If you wish for a solo room outside the Temple, please see one of the many i-&quot;

&quot;CLAM IT WOULD YA? I&#39;M TIRED OF THIS NONS-&quot;

A young man speaks up, stopping the argument, &quot;Enough, Kouoris! I told you not to drag it on this long.&quot;

The large man called Kouoris turns to face him, kneeling, &quot;Master Ptolomeos, I did not mean to wake you until I had secured a room.&quot;

&quot;&lt;i&gt;&#39;Did not mean to&#39;&lt;/i&gt;? Clearly you&#39;re joking. I leave you alone for &lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt; morning and &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; is how you choose to act?&quot;

&quot;But my lord I was doing it for the sake of the Ra&#39;ashtari house!&quot;

&quot;For the sake of the Ra&#39;ashtari house? You&#39;re ruining our reputation by making it seem like we only hire ruffians off the roads as our guards, and say it is for the sake of our clan? Do you hear yourself?&quot;

Kouoris is silent. 

&quot;Return to the carriage. You are find an inn to stay at &lt;i&gt;by yourself&lt;/i&gt; until the tournament completes. You are not to leave unless it is an emergency. Understood?&quot;

&quot;B-But what about your safety?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m both a Crusader candidate and Ra&#39;ashtari VI&#39;s eldest son, and you &lt;i&gt;dare&lt;/i&gt; worry for my safety?&quot;

Kouoris is silenced once more. He bows and boards the carriage. It departs from the area. After the disturbance ended, I look around and see a small crowd has formed watching the scene from a few paces as well. Eventually a line forms. It seems as if these are all candidates in the tournament that just arrived. Each pair is greeted and taken in by an attendent somewhere within this building, seemingly to their room. It seems like my roomate is the person in front of me. His tattered bandana and cloth mask give him the appearance of a rogue.

&lt;i&gt;Seems like quite the lovely conversationalist doesn&#39;t he?&lt;/i&gt;
***

The attendant has shown us to our room. I place my bag on the bed to the left, while he throws his under his bed on the right. He then just rolls into bed and falls asleep, seemingly. I never actually caught his name either.

At least he isn&#39;t annoying.

It&#39;s about 1 hour past sunset right now. I should...

[[Go look for the temple library]] 
[[Roam the halls]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="18" name="Cutscene 0 Replacement Text" tags="" position="125,1975" size="100,100">&quot;It begins with the 7 Supreme Beings who oversaw the world. 

The seven gods watched over their followers who were complacent in their role. Humanity to them was an existence that existed with no greater purpose or greater calling. Over the next centuries, the Gods&#39; names would be spread.

Vitus, the God of Life, began to change humans by giving them Life. And with life came the ability to live and choose for themselves. Thus he gave them Life.

Morrigan, the Goddess of Death, however, saw that giving the human life an end would give them rest from the troubles that life had offered them while also making it so that the human life becomes more meaningful. Thus she gave them Death.

Then, Sofiya, the Goddess of Wisdom, attempted to share her wisdom with mankind. She wished to give them the knowledge to learn, teach, and grow throughout their lives. Thus she gave them Wisdom.

Polemos, the God of War, taught the humans War, as Polemos felt lives without conflict were simply too monotonous to be considered worth living. Thus he gave them War.

Solus, God of the Day, and Luna, Goddess of the Night, looked towards the heavens. They decided to grant the human life structure, and their eternal dance is what creates the pattern of Day and Night that governs mankind. Thus, they gave them the Day, and the Night.

However, while the other Gods wished for the humans to grow, learn, and thrive, Seraphus did not share their benevolence. Humanity disgusted her, with their flaws and arrogance causing her to resent them simply for existing. She saw the Gods creating something which she believed ought to be destroyed. She believed that since the humans would inevitably wipe themselves out through their greed and malice, it was better for her to wipe them out. Thus, the Chaos-Serpent God began her rampage over the world, bringing mayhem and monstrosities in her wake, causing death and destruction on a magnitude never seen before. She caused earthquakes, demolished humanity&#39;s greatest structures, created all manner of evil creatures from the human corpses, and feasted upon all the ravaged and tormented souls. Her final plan was to encircle the earth that she may swallow it up for good, bringing an end to this futile game the Gods seemed foolishly intent on playing.

However, the 6 other Gods took a stand against the Great Serpent and sealed her with the 7 seals, and to this day Seraphus lies there, awaiting her release once more...

Or maybe...
It is before your very eyes...</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="20" name="Chapter IV - The Tournament of Crusaders" tags="" position="4025,3175" size="100,100">THE FIRST TRIAL
The first trial is the Sphinx&#39;s riddles. Clay is in a team of 10 people among 3 teams. It plays out as follows:

Riddle 1: &quot;I have two arms, when one rises the other falls. When all is orderly, the arms are still. If a man holds my hand, he is deceiving you. What am I?&quot;
The team suggests
 - A Lever
 - A Woman
 + A Scale(From Clay)
 
This answer is obvious. The real choice is whether or not Clay will rush in and answer first. If he doesn&#39;t, then the second team will answer. 

Riddle 2: &quot;What is above speech, besides listening, and before intellect.&quot;
Ars immediately shouts that the answer is an Eye. He knows this because he was given this prophecy by the Death Goddess that one day someone will ask him this question, and that this is the answer. Everyone shouts at him and one person nearly attacks him for it, but the Sphinx responds that he is correct. 

Riddle 3: &quot;7 Snakes have bitten me with 4 fangs, I am now paralyzed. What am I?&quot;
This riddle is impossibly difficult for the teams, as they know it is a symbolic question. No team can arrive at the answer. Sofiya orders The Sphinx give the answer. With a large laugh, he utters that it is Seraphus. Sofiya states that it is false, there are only 6 Gods and 7 Seals used, 7 and 4 is an absurd pair. The Sphinx arises and declares &quot;I am Ao, I speak only the truth.&quot; Sofiya is enraged and places a Greater Seal on Ao, and declares henceforth that the Sphinx has succumb to insanity. She continues that the Trials will continue as usual. 

Clay will spot Alethia sneaking around here


THE SECOND TRIAL

The second trial is magic circle reconstruction. Clay is a master at this, as he&#39;s needed to do this countless times after each time Grimstone botches an experimental magic circle in an experiment. Magic Circles however are a form of magic that is considered extremely complex and slow, meaning very few choose to learn how to form or fix them. 

Clay repairs his magic cirlce instantly. Next to him he sees Ars struggling with his. He could choose to sneak the answer to Ars. If he decides to, Ars will be his opponent in the Combat Trial. If not, he will face someone far stronger in the final trial.

Alethia will target Clay while he trains and nearly kidnap him here[Insert kidnapping sequence]

THE THIRD TRIAL

The final trial is the trial of combat.
- If you helped Ars
    
    - Ars has 3 ways to be beaten and 1 way to lose against him
    
- If you didn&#39;t help Ars
    You face off against Nakht, a stronger opponent with 1 way to win and 4 ways to lose.
	
The day after the final trial is a relatively relaxed time. Most of the candidates are heading back home. Some are going out for celebrations. The options available depend on whether or not you spoke to certain people over the course of the Tournament

He runs through the Bazaar, before finally cornering them in an Alleyway... or perhaps...being cornered himself.
Clay tries communication, but the person simply rushes at him. 

He puts up a wall of earth between him and the figure, but she breaks through it. 
He realizes that she used no magic.
He realizes he must escape. 
Clay tries fighting back using Shock Pulse, but the figure simply ignores them. 
Clay tries Earth Spire, but the figure stands atop the end of it unphased, then rushes down at Clay. 
Clay is near-instantly overwhelmed. He is tied up. The figure essentially incapacitates him.
All Clay can do is watch and hear. He recognizes the figure is at least a girl(hurts his pride a little).
Clay watches the figure look around panicked. Suddenly, 10 high ranking pages appear around the red cloaked kidnapper. A fight ensues, she escapes. Clay is freed, and they return. Clay is warned about the presence of a Candidate-napper: someone who has been kidnapping the candidates. The pages can&#39;t make heads or tails of why they are kidnapping them. 
Clay is sent back to his room.
[[Return to my RoomOLD]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="23" name="It&#39;s just another page" tags="" position="4475,3000" size="100,100">Clay disregards it, and continues walking. He sees Sofiya and her servants walk through the Garden, although they are veiling her from the sun. They walk past Clay, Sofiya says something to one of her servants, and the servant relays the message. It&#39;s more or less her hoping he has gotten used to being there.
If Clay continues to walk through the Garden, he can choose to speak to the Gardener.
[[Speak to the Gardener]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="24" name="Speak to the Gardener" tags="" position="4350,3175" size="100,100">Clay can ask the Gardener about

Same deal as the first day. 
The training regime this time is to force him to increase his regeneration speed of magical energy, as he stands the best chance of surviving that way. The traditional way of doing so is to have him expend his magical energy for as long as possible continuously. The way they plan to do that is to place some amulets on him. These amulets continously siphen his magical energy supply. For a few days, he will be utterly and totally exhausted in terms of mana. Since he can&#39;t cast spells to any real capacity during this time, he will be doing physical training. Clay is already fit, so they are polishing his existing skills. 
Clay will be learning to dodge properly over the next few days. 
Clay will not be having fun. 
After today&#39;s work, he will be presented with the same three options.

(Clay can sense security is at its absolute maximum. He constantly feels followed).
Some of the pages are presumably on break. Clay doesn&#39;t feel like interrupting their fun. 
The gardener is still here, he seems distressed. He also notices the pages.

If you choose to ask about what he knows about the pages, he will respond with the fact his wife is actually a page, and so is his daughter. He tells Clay to keep it a secret.

If asked more about them, he&#39;ll be given a rundown of their lives, save for their names.

[[Next Day(II) BREAK DAY!]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="30" name="PLOT POINT: ROYAL SELECTION" tags="Notes" position="4425,2450" size="100,100">The Royal Selection

The IR&#39;s governance is part republic, part monarchy. 
The King and Queens are elected. The previous King(King Perceus Rex VI) of the IR passed away, leaving behind his royal family. Given the election-based succession system of the Kingdom, all members of the Kingdom technically have a chance at ruling, but the rulers always end up being of the upper crust of society.

The most prominent candidates for the selection are
1) Prince Prometheus (First child of King Rex), a corrupt character who still holds most of the public&#39;s opinion in his favor
2) Lady Priscilla(Noble of House of Athena, named for the war hero that founded it), her opinion is very very strong among the merchants
3) Princess(a nominal title) Alethia Polemos I, a young girl who is the daughter of the War God, has the backing of War God Polemos, and was granted the title Princess by him. [THIS IS THIA]

Polemos is scheming to get Alethia into power because they want to abolish the royal succession through a loophole in the succession system. The entire congress of the republic is against her, and offered her a public challenge where they would support her if she herself goes as Polemos&#39;s Crusader.

This all went according to plan.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="31" name="Next Day(II) BREAK DAY!" tags="" position="4025,2825" size="100,100">!!!!THERE ARE CHOICES IN THIS PASSAGE!!!!!!!!!!
Most are inconsequential and are thus summarized here in one node.

Timeskip to 4 days later, Clay is finally used to the amulets.
He hears a knock at his door. This time its not his Mentor, but rather a messenger. He has been a note from his Mentor. 

The note will read &quot;Today is a day off. He fought hard for this day off, so Clay better enjoy it. The one condition is he is not permitted to remove the Amulets, and he must also equip one more.&quot; The amulet is bundled together with the note. Clay reluctantly puts it on and his sense of comfort has disappeared.

Clay has also been given some payment for his time here as Crusader, courtesy of the Goddess: 100 Gold Coins. Clay remembers that Alexandrian Gold is worth less than Ionian Gold, possibly due to a stronger economy.

As he turns around, he sees the red cloaked figure in the window, only to be subsequently chased away by a few pages.

Clay will spend his morning wandering the streets of Alexandria, accompanied by a page escort. Eventually he will realize that the page in question is Anya once more. He asks why she is there, and she says one word: &quot;decoy.&quot;

Clay infers she&#39;s there to make it look like she&#39;s the only person guarding him. He recognizes that memorable feeling of being watched once more.

He is going to an old spot he visited with Grimstone once to check if a mark he left is still there. It is. After verifying this, he will return back to the palace. 

Looking back, he could have sworn he saw a flash of red by the tree. 

Its about noontime, Clay and Anya are hungry. Returning to the Palace seems smart

As they go back, they see people at the guild placing news at the board regarding the War God&#39;s Crusader. All Clay can say is that the girl looks rather intimidating, and Anya agrees.

Once it&#39;s about the afternoon, Anya and Clay part ways at the doors of the castle, and Clay enters. A servant has a message for him stating he is summoned before the Goddess.

The servants waste no time in dragging him off to be prepared. 

In about an hour, the meeting occurs. Another servant speaks on behalf of the Goddess(who is present behind a veil), asking about Clay&#39;s progress. She also offers him a chance to withdraw if he feels he is not able, they say they will call back Nakht to replace him.
Clay won&#39;t withdraw.

The servant reminds him the ceremony is in one week. He should brace himself for it. 

After eating his lunch, Clay is free.

It is now the afternoon, where will Clay go?

While training for a few hours, the figure will approach him.
For the first time, they will finally speak.
	1. At first Clay will try to signal for help by casting Shockwave, but Alethia puts out her hand saying &quot;Wait!&quot;
	2. She will then ask him why he answered the summons to be a Crusader, Clay said he was essentially forced to by his Mentor. Alethia will be shocked at this, and tells him that he&#39;s risking his life doing this. Clay responds saying &quot;well I suppose I am, yeah.&quot; Alethia will ask him how he can just gamble with his life so easily, Clay will ask her why she&#39;s gambling with her life by trying to kidnap these Crusaders. Alethia will respond that she&#39;s doing it under orders.
Clay: &quot;aren&#39;t you playing with your life just as much?&quot;
Alethia: &quot;Well, I am stronger than you. I can handle myself.&quot;
Clay: &quot;Well you seemed like you weren&#39;t &#39;handling yourself&#39; when you last tried to kidnap me.&quot;
Alethia: &quot;Oh please it&#39;s just because I didn&#39;t want to have to get serious.&quot;
Clay will mockingly imitate her.
Alethia: &quot;Seriously how old are you, are you unable to come up with a better comback than just-?&quot;
Clay: &quot;And are you unable to do anything other than follow me all day?&quot;
Alethia: &quot;FOLLOWING YOU? Okay hotshot, you get an ounce of attention from your kidnapper and suddenly you&#39;re a celebrity?&quot;
Clay:&quot;Mad?&quot;
Alethia will go for a punch, Clay will dodge effortlessly. Alethia will go for a few more hits, and she whiffs each one. 
Clay: &quot;Oh c&#39;mon missy, why not go &#39;serious&#39; like you were talking all high n&#39; mighty about just a second ago?&quot;
Alethia will step back and pull out her two blades and form them into a bow, drawing a magic arrow and say &quot;Draw your weapon, Crusader of Sofiya.&quot;
Clay will respond with, &quot;Too bad, don&#39;t need to&quot;, and reveal the hole he had been digging beneath her feet using magic. 
Clay will fire a Shock pulse at her hands as she falls and knock her weapon away. Clay will then seal the hole around her waste so she&#39;s stuck in the ground. 
Alethia will try to resist but fail.
Clay will sit right next to her cross-legged and say &quot;Well miss, you appear have not gone &#39;serious&#39; yet, can your &#39;seriousness&#39; get you out of this trap?&quot;
Alethia will use magic to shatter the ground around her and pull herself out, Clay will roll away, saying &quot;Oh you have magic too? No fair!&quot;
Alethia will grab her weapon, stand and point a shortsword at him saying &quot;Listen here, magician boy-&quot;
&quot;Magician boy?&quot;
&quot;I&#39;ll let you stay a Crusader. But know who you&#39;ve made a rival of-&quot;
&quot;Rival? I swear I didn&#39;t sign up for this.&quot;
&quot;I Alethia Polemos VI-&quot;
&quot;Who?&quot;
This will make Alethia stop.
&quot;You&#39;re mocking me again?&quot;
&quot;No seriously, who?&quot;
&quot;I SAW YOU READING THE SIGN EARLIER WITH MY FACE ON IT?&quot;
&quot;Oh so you were stalking me then too? Man you&#39;re good at that, I hadn&#39;t even sensed you then.&quot;
&quot;I should just end you here and now then huh.&quot;
Alethia will realize the pages are on their way, and she will bid farewell.
Clay will mutter, &quot;I didn&#39;t even get a chance to call you ugly.&quot;
Alethia, &quot;I HEARD THAT!&quot;

At this point, it is now sunset.

Clay will continue reading a book in the library

Later, things will be very calm. Clay will hear a voice and some footsteps. Peering over, Clay can see a young woman wearing all white, fairly basic clothes too. 
At first he can ignore her. But eventually she seems worried. Clay saunters over. Clay asks what&#39;s wrong, she says she can&#39;t find a book she left here. Clay asks if it&#39;s important. The woman says it is. Clay agrees to help find it, and asks for the name of the book.
The book&#39;s name is:
&quot;Queen&#39;s Assassin - The Killer and the Soldier - Third Kingdom Arc: Volume 5&quot;
Clay is dumbfounded by the name of the book. Clay asks again if it is absolutely important, the woman says it is with every fiber of her being. Clay is swept away by her determination, and agrees to help. For a few hours, he helps her find the book. It ends up being mixed up in the stack of books Clay was going to read, he picked it up by mistake. 
At the end, Clay asks what her name is, and she simply smiles and walks away.
Clay goes to read his book, and a maid comes in to alert him that it is time for dinner. Clay is crestfallen and goes to his room. 
[[Rite of the Divine Pact]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="32" name="Neo I" tags="Side-Story" position="475,2025" size="100,100">&lt;size=150&gt; &quot;You&#39;re a Good Kid&quot;&lt;size=100&gt;
Neo was recovering from his battle against Clay.
&quot;DAMMIT. WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT POWER- ERGH-&quot;, he coughed up blood and drew a deep breath, before slumping against a tree.
&quot;IT CAN&#39;T BE IT CAN&#39;T BE IT CAN&#39;T BE! ONLY WE HAVE THAT POWER. NOBODY CAN USE THE POWER OF THE FORSAKEN SERPENT EXCEPT I.&quot; His wounds began to flow with more blood, as his rage was lit ablaze. 
&quot;I SWEAR....I WILL DEFEAT HIM...HE WILL BE BROUGHT DOWN....On my....honor.&quot;
Neo&#39;s flame of rage began to wither as exhaustion overtook him.

&quot;Mister? Hey Mister? Are you okay?&quot;
Neo heard a voice as he began to wake up. A juvenile voice filled with innocence. 
&quot;WHO&#39;S THERE?&quot;
Neo veiled his arm in void energy, and shielded himself with its claws. 
&quot;Mister?&quot;
The voice said again, Neo&#39;s vision began to clear up, a child stood before him. A young boy who seemed no older than 7. 
&quot;What- What the hell are you doing here brat?!&quot;
Neo wanted to kill the child, but the resistance to doing so balanced it out. Why did he hesitate?
&quot;Mister, you&#39;re hurt. Don&#39;t get too worked up.&quot;
&quot;SHUT UP YOU- AGHh&quot;
Neo tried swinging his arm to scare off the kid, but seemed to open up another wound. 
&quot;Aaah! Mister is bleeding again! Hold still!&quot;
The kid ran up to Neo, who was too tired to resist, and began casting healing magic.
&quot;You&#39;re going to make me tired again if you keep moving like this. No more! Understood?&quot;
&quot;Again? Huh? What? Were you already doing this?&quot;
&quot;Yes I was!&quot;, the kid said proudly,&quot;My mommy always told me to use my power to help people, and you needed help, so I did.&quot;
The child&#39;s smile seemed to pierce Neo&#39;s demeanor. He looked away. 
&quot;You&#39;re....You&#39;re a good kid, brat.&quot;
&quot;Hey you called me a brat again! Meanie&quot;

&quot;But the griffins were in the forest this week it was a-&quot;
&quot;I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s a griffin, a Dragon, or your evil twin. You have 3 months of national budget proposals to review and you haven&#39;t even STARTED them.&quot;

&quot;Whoa whoa whoa&quot;, whoa-ed Clay as he walked in, &quot;nobody, and I mean NOBODY, is allowed to copy my character dynamic with Grimstone. If you want to interact with him so badly, find a different gimmick.&quot;

&quot;Hey!&quot;, said Alethia, &quot;You are not the &#39;copyrighter of character dynamics&#39;, Clay. What reason should I have for honoring your stupid sense of ownership over a style of communication? Hm?&quot;

&quot;Plot armor&quot;, Clay looks up to the sky as he awaits the voices of the two losers who authored his accursed life.

From the heavens, two voices sing out in perfect unison, &quot;We promised no such thing in this game.&quot;

&quot;DAMMIT!&quot;, Clay stormed out.``</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="34" name="Rite of the Divine Pact" tags="" position="4050,3025" size="100,100">6 days pass and it is now the day before the rite. The scene opens with another fight scene between him and his Mentor. This time, Clay is able to hold his own. He cannot quite win, but he surely won&#39;t lose. Most of this fight is Clay dodging and using magic to aide himself. 
After this last fight, Clay will ask why his mentor can&#39;t himself be a Crusader. His mentor will simply respond, &quot;I wasn&#39;t chosen, our Goddess&#39;s will is hers and hers alone.&quot;
Clay will shrug at this. 

Clay will be called by a servant to go get ready. Skip to when he&#39;s clothed, he&#39;s dressed up all fancily. Clay looks out from his window in the Palace and sees people gathered. The guards lined the palace doors which were wide open. The Palace barrier had been activated. 

Clay will be escorted into the hall, performing the tradition of swearing his oath before the throne of Sofiya while holding his sword(which he won&#39;t be using). Clay is then placed inside of the sarcophagus. As he learned, he will use one of the scarab amulets he was given to drain his mana till he can just barely remain concious. Once he reaches this state, the Amulet will signal Sofiya to step forward and commence the ritual(this is the one time in a year where most people will ever see her). Sofiya uses the blade and pricks her finger, letting a drop of blood fall into one of the crevices of the sarcophagus. Muttering a few words, the blood decomposes into divine essence and fills all the crevices and eventually fills the entirety of the Sarcophagus, Clay feels like he&#39;s being engulfed in flames as this happens. Right as the pain reaches its peak, he suddenly feels an overwhelming sense of strength and regains his senses. As he was instructed from this point onwards, he will remove all 14 Scarab Amulets and present them to Sofiya upon his reawakening. This is when the contract between him and Sofiya is established. Taking a glance upwards he&#39;ll realize that he&#39;s looking at that same girl from earlier, and is fighting to keep his composure. Sofiya returns the blade and the rite is over. A feast is held outside and an artist comes to paint Clay&#39;s portrait to be spread across the nations. 
Clay is then instructed to go to the training arena with Sofiya to activate his Divine Blessing. He is unable to. Sofiya is in shambles.

At this moment, Sofiya&#39;s device named Ra, announces the beginning of the Crusades in one week. The situation looks pretty bad.

The Gods each arrive in Alexandria with their respective Crusaders.
The first Carriage, or rather pair of Carriages, were a bright Gold and a deep Black(with a Gothic Aesthetic). There is a massive crowd in the streets, and soldiers everywhere to keep people in-line. Then follows Morrigan&#39;s carriage which a deep brown mixed with reddish-orange in places, surrounded with Crows. After that is a Carriage colored white and blue that almost looks like it is made of ice. After that is a Carriage of red and black, with soldiers surrounding it.
They arrive at the entrance to the Temple of Wisdom. Clay is at the gate of the temple. A servant announces that Sofiya will now be leaving the temple&#39;s veils. The doors will open revealing Sofiya at walking out with servants preceeding her. She stands at the gate, and Clay is taken aback at the scene.

&quot;As per the ancient custom, come forth and present yourselves.&quot;
Each of the carriages will open. Starting with the first two.
&quot;Solus, God of the Sun.&quot; The area becomes much brighter.
&quot;Luna, Goddess of the Moon.&quot; The lighting returns to normal.
&quot;Morrigan, Goddess of Death.&quot; Upon seeing Clay she will visibly look surprised.
&quot;Vitus, God of Life.&quot; 
&quot;AND LAST AND GREATEST, THE WAR GOD HIMSELF, POLEMOS!&quot; Polemos will leap out, kiss his bicepts, and flex. The other Gods will shake their heads, muttering about him never changing, but Polemos pays no attention to it.

&quot;I, Sofiya, Will be presiding over this Trial of the 2,000th Crusade, of the year 20,000 of the Divine Era. Any objections?&quot; 
&quot;I have a few.&quot; Polemos says.
&quot;No objections-?&quot;
&quot;I just said I have some.&quot;
&quot;Then we shall proceed.&quot;
Polemos sighs heavily.

Sofiya nods to Clay, and it is his turn to do the same.
&quot;As per the ancient custom, come forth and present yourselves.&quot;
&quot;Verina Sunbearer, eldest daughter of the Stargazer House of the Gate of Heaven, and Crusader of The Sun God.&quot;
&quot;Perceus Stargazer, Crusader of Luna.&quot;
&quot;Lugh Tombsword, Crusader of the Death Goddess.&quot; 
&quot;Lily Frostknight, daughter of the Frostknight Clerical Family and Crusader of The Life God.&quot;
&quot;Alethia Ares Polemos VI, 6th and youngest child of Polemos the War God, and 4th Princess of the Ionian Royal Family.&quot;, she says with curtsey. Clay is visibly taken aback, thinking this can&#39;t be the same girl who tried to kidnap him.
&quot;I, Clay, disciple of Grimstone, will be serving under Sofiya the Wisdom Goddess, who presides over this Trial of the 2,000th Crusade, of the year 20,000 of the Divine Era.&quot;

The servants of Sofiya will be going to each God&#39;s servants to show them the rooms each will stay at. The Gods will each follow Sofiya into the Temple, followed by the Crusaders being left alone. 

Clay can choose to:

Lily will try to hold in her laughter. Verina will look away smirking. Lugh be mostly silent, but he does seem to be paying attention.
Alethia will say &quot;Indeed it&#39;s very taxing.&quot;
&quot;Ohoho, so you can be &#39;serious&#39; in social situations too?&quot;, Clay will retort.
&quot;Do you two know each other?&quot;, Verina will ask.
&quot;Not quite, but get a load of this, Ms.Princess over here went and tried to-&quot;, Alethia will toss a dagger in Clay&#39;s direction, everyone looks at Alethia who says &quot;Aah my hand slipped.&quot;
Clay will sigh, and say, &quot;Well I&#39;m assuming I can at least keep my head if I only reintroduce myself. I&#39;m Clay, hobbies include reading, reseaching magic, and selling rare gemstones. No last name, I&#39;m not in any sort of nobility as you all seem to be, not that it matters for the Trial tonight!&quot;
Lugh will point out, &quot;Ah, I&#39;m not a noble either. I&#39;m just in an old Blackmsithing Family. Tombsword is just the name of both our smithery, and our family name because of it.&quot;
&quot;So you&#39;re the blacksmith from the Death Goddess Kingdom? How did Lady Morrigan choose someone of such a peculiar upbringing? Typically they&#39;re in knightly families, no?&quot;, Verina says.
&quot;It&#39;s...a long story&quot;, Lugh says, avoiding the topic.
&quot;I want to know more about you! Sir Stargazer. I&#39;ve heard the legends about your family! Do you truly have the remnant of dead stars hidden under your estate? What do you use them for?&quot;, Lily jumps in.
&quot;Please- Just call me Perceus. As for our estate...well...&quot;
Verina will cut in and say, &quot;I&#39;m sorry but asking such a thing is poor taste at the moment. Such information isn&#39;t given out so freely. Please understand&quot;, Verina tries to spare Perceus from needing to share.
Lily quickly will apologize and step back. 
Perceus, sensing the tension, will try and ease things by asking about Lily, &quot;So uh...Clerical family for Vitus...what&#39;s that like?&quot;
&quot;Oh- uh, me? Well...&quot;, she fumbles with her words, &quot;...The Life God has been very gracious to our family, enabling me to train directly under him to help his Healing Ministry. The Princess would know of our work in The Republic.&quot;
Alethia will nod, stating, &quot;The Theocracy&#39;s support has been pivotal in recent endeavors. You may have heard this already, but on behalf of The War God I extend my gratitude.&quot;
Clay will roll his eyes at all of this. It went from a casual conversation to international diplomacy in an instant. He&#39;s hoping it doesn&#39;t always become like this.
After a while, </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="40" name="Grovel" tags="Done" position="275,825" size="100,100">...ask her like I&#39;m begging for water in a desert.

&quot;PLEASE-!&quot;
I get on all fours and prostrate myself. 
&quot;I NEED THIS INFORMATION!&quot;

&quot;GET AWA- ah- huh?&quot;, the wild swinging stops.

&quot;PLEASE, I&#39;M COMPLETELY LOST WITHOUT IT! HELP ME!&quot;

I remain as is. Any more and I literally will be incapable of facing myself after this. 

&quot;Heh. Haha. HAHAHAHAHA! YES! YOU DO NEED THIS INFORMATION! THAT IS WHY I AM HERE! THE GREAT KNOWER OF THINGS! WELL, BOY!&quot;, I hear her staff be planted on the ground firmly, &quot;I SUPPOSE I MUST SHARE THIS MORSEL OF KNOWLEDGE WITH YOU!&quot;

I am fighting so hard to not just kill myself here and now for having allowed it to go this far.

&quot;When you go searching near the Wall of Heroes for a proper place to set up a stand, you shall find two children on a cart. One of them has a oversized crow mask. Tell them the password and they shall hand over the finest spot in all the city. The password is...&quot;

She leans down, I can hear her breathing before saying.

&quot;...&#39;Grimmy&#39;&quot;

With that, she vanishes.

I feel this name is quite familiar yet I can&#39;t quite make sense of it.

In other news, I am no longer on the ground. I seem to now be on the roof of the building which lined the right side of the alley, moving rapidly in the direction of the Inn. It appears as if I have been kidnapped.

&quot;When I said &#39;Do not leave the room&#39;, I seemed to have forgotten to take into account that personality of yours. Is this an inbuilt defect or did you learn this yourself?&quot;, my kidnapper says.

&quot;H-Hey Nadia...lovely weather isn&#39;t it?&quot;

&quot;Quite. It seems quite strange that you are experiencing it so thoroughly.&quot;

&quot;Well...that...&quot;, there isn&#39;t much I can say to shield myself here. 

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll leave the majority of the scolding to your teacher.&quot;

&lt;i&gt; Great Nadia! Thanks! Can&#39;t wait! &lt;/i&gt;

...

And so we make it back to the Inn. Nadia sets me down at my bed. She readies the next set of bandages. 

&lt;i&gt;I think she&#39;s going to make these ones hurt. &lt;/i&gt;

I was right. 

***

Enough time has gone by such that Nadia has removed most of the bandages. I can move my arms freely now. Spells are still not doable, however. 

It is just before sunset, and Grimstone&#39;s footsteps echo through the door from the hall. The door creaks open.

&quot;Welcome back, Master Grimstone.&quot;

&quot;Thank you very much for your work Nadia you may leave. I&#39;ll take it from here.&quot;

&quot;Of course Master Grimstone. I will be returning to Lord Necron. I will give him your regards&quot;, she bows before walking out the door.

&quot;Of course&quot;, he says as he drops his stuff by his side table, &quot;Well Clay. Care to explain why you disregarded your recovery?&quot;, his blindfolded eyes stare into my soul.

&quot;Before you place me under house arrest,&quot; I place a hand up to shield my face, &quot;I may have some information that may be of use to you.&quot;

&quot;Oh...? Do tell. How useful could it possibly be?&quot;

&quot;It involves the ideal space to set up our merchandise stand. I finally know where it is.&quot;

I relay the information the suspicious informant told me.

***
&quot;YOU&#39;RE SERIOUS? IT WAS THAT SIMPLE?&quot;, Grimstone slams both hands on his bedside before collapsing onto the mattress, &quot;I passed by that damn cart 10 times...that woman...&quot;

&quot;Wait, you believe me?&quot;

&quot;Unfortunately...yes. I&#39;ll set up tomorrow morning. Get some rest, and forget about that woman you saw. You&#39;re better off doing so anyways.&quot;

***
After about an hour or so, Grimstone heads to sleep. I pull out my book of Legends, picking up from where I left off. Tonight&#39;s story regards The Offering and its origins.

There are differing accounts regarding how it started. However the central idea is that the Necron house once returned the weapon Necron to the Goddess Morrigan. This gift is a reenactment of that day. 

&lt;i&gt; It just seems like a scam...to earn more...money...&lt;/i&gt;

Are my last thoughts before I head to sleep.

[[And The Rite of Prophecy Begins...]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="41" name="Tombsword Smithery Stall" tags="Done" position="75,575" size="100,100">visitedSmithery:true

&quot;...The smithery stall nearby seems good&quot;, I wave to Grimstone and walk towards it.

It seems rather well put-together. Whoever runs it must be experienced. Though...what&#39;s with the guards surrounding it?

I make my way to the stall. The familiar brown-cloaked guards of the city are at the stall. One of them holding a letter and pleading with a rather sturdily built man with a cloak over his right arm, &quot;Please Sir Lugh-&quot;

&quot;...just &#39;Lugh&#39; is fine&quot;, the sturdy one says while wiping down the frame of his stall with a rag.

&quot;-her highness is earnestly requesting that you return to the castle immediately for rehersal. We can&#39;t risk mistakes tomorrow!&quot;

&quot;I get it I get it. Let me clean up my shop first. Can&#39;t have dust on the merchandise.&quot;

&quot;I still don&#39;t get why you are working so hard at this stall. You won&#39;t even be present here for most of the event.&quot;

&quot;All the more reason to make sure everything is ready for that short time I am available. I&#39;m going to be a walking advertisement, after all.&quot;

The guards seem rather distraught. I could make this my one good deed for the day...or...

&quot;Excuse m-,&quot; I puff out my chest and broaden my shoulders,&quot;&lt;i&gt;Ahem.&lt;/i&gt;-You there! In the cloak!&quot;

The large man turns his body towards me, &quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;You seem to be of some importance and behind schedule. If it is just cleaning you need, I&#39;ll take care of it for-&quot;, an object flies at me, I wince before realizing it&#39;s a gold coin. I instantly snatch it out of the air. 

&quot;Cool. Do it well. Later&quot;, he drops the rag he was holding into the bucket next to him. He walks off with the others. The soldiers don&#39;t even thank me for saving their sorry selves from secondhand tardiness. The nerve of some people!

But hey! Money!

I pick up where he left off. By the time I&#39;m done it&#39;s sunset and the entire area is spotless. It seems he has some smithery items out as decorations. Honestly, he went overkill. It almost looks like he&#39;s attempting to do it all on the spot. That&#39;d be practically impossible given how fast people would order items, they&#39;d wait for hours!

Anyways, I&#39;ll head back now. It&#39;s time to plan out the big day.

[[Meet with Grimstone]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="42" name="General area" tags="Done" position="250,675" size="100,100">metAlethia:true

&quot;...I&#39;ll just browse around. Might as well get a little of everything&quot;, I wave to Grimstone and set off.

I pass by a few food stands. There&#39;s spiced and glazed mutton being sold at a food stall, apparently being slow cooked from now till tomorrow. There&#39;s pastries which are twisted into the shape of a shepherd&#39;s crook. Upon closer inspection it appears to be run by the Necron house. Goodness, they do take their brand seriously huh?

I continue my circling around the Wall of Heroes. The stalls shift from food to magic items. I see one place selling scrolls for prices that make my pockets hurt. Another stand has Magic Charms but from what I can tell they&#39;re of a very cheap variety, I&#39;m rather glad me and Grimstone can make our own. There&#39;s another which advertises an auction for a magic sword. The starting price is more than I think I&#39;ll ever make till I die. 

Soon I start to see far more clothing. There&#39;s fine silk cloaks with designs depicting the Goddess in one stall, and in another I see shawls which depict ravens in a field of roses.

The clothing area was quite short, and I start to get towards the stalls featuring weapons. One thing catches my eye.

Red hair. A deep red. A red so vibrant that it freezes me in place. This person is nobility from the Ionian Republic, no question. In fact it wouldn&#39;t be hard to believe she was royalty. Her hair has gold pins in it, with a bun that has a spiraling gold ornament holding it together. She starts to turn in my direction.

&lt;i&gt; LOOK AWAY LOOK AWAY LOOK AWAY &lt;/i&gt;

 I look off towards the right side of the street and continue my walk. She walks the other way, but gets rather close in the process. As I pass her I look at the stall she was just at.

&#39;Pets and Pups Commemorative Toys Stall.&#39;

They sell an assortment of toys for pets. I think I saw her buying a chew toy. Maybe I should get a pet.

Wait, no. I can&#39;t have another useless thing to take care of.

I just about wrap up. I think it&#39;s about time to head back to the inn now.

[[Meet with Grimstone]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="43" name="Old Intro" tags="" position="250,1975" size="100,100">@c001@@p003@
At the steps of a rustic-looking abandoned home, on the outskirts of a small village, the excited voices of children could be heard amidst the sounds of crickets during sunset...
&quot;Neo! Neo! Tell it again!,&quot; a young boy with brown hair says to the older boy sitting in front of him.
&quot;Haven&#39;t you had enough already Clay? It&#39;s the 3rd time I&#39;ve told you today!?,&quot; the older boy responds exasperated.
&quot;No fair Neo! We found birds in the forest with you and Louis yesterday! You promised!!&quot; a young girl sitting next to Clay whines, &quot;After all, you didn&#39;t want to go rabbit-hunting with us today.&quot;
&quot;You too, Thia? What&#39;s gotten into you two? It&#39;s not like the story changes because I tell it.&quot; Neo says, &quot;Also, we don&#39;t want to get in the way of the hunters Thia, you know that.&quot;
&quot;Neo, you promised me, and Thia! A promise is a promise.&quot; Clay crosses his arms, sitting down in front of Neo.
&quot;Yeah!&quot; Thia follows.
&quot;Okay okay...but this’ll be the last time today.&quot;
@t000@@p003@&quot;Wow, the War God is so cool!&quot; the young girl says, swinging around a stick as if it were a sword, and proclaims, &quot;but my mom says &#39;warrior&#39; instead of &#39;war&#39;. Hiyah-!&quot;
&quot;Hey- Quit it- Ow! Neo help!&quot; Clay responds, being her training dummy.
&quot;Just be a better warrior Clay! Hah!&quot; Thia jabbed at him.
&quot;Cut it out!&quot; Clay said, &quot;jUsT Be a BetTeR WarRioR ClAy blah blah- oW!&quot;
&quot;UGH! Your voice is so stupid every time you copy me.&quot;
&quot;Its cause I&#39;m copying a stupid voice, stupid.&quot;
&quot;Okay, okay, you two,&quot; Neo cuts in, &quot;enough playing around. It&#39;s dark, we need to get you home.&quot;
&quot;Neo!&quot;
&quot;Yes, Clay?&quot; 
&quot;Will Seraphus really return someday?&quot;
Neo pauses and thinks, then smirks.
&quot;If she does, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll protect you,&quot; he says, puffing out his chest proudly.
&quot;Whoaaahhh!&quot; They beam in admiration.
&quot;Okay, okay, it&#39;s time to go. For real now.&quot;
&quot;Fiiiiiiiinnnnnneeeee,&quot; Thia tosses away the stick in her hand, as Clay flinches thinking it was another attack.@p007@
Neo picks up his bow, gets up, and starts walking down the steps of his house when he notices something off in the distance, &quot;That smell…  is it blood?&quot;
&quot;Neo? You look worried.&quot;
&quot;Neoooooooooooooo, c&#39;mon I want to practice swinging the sword more, are you sure we have to have to HAVE TO leave?&quot;
&quot;Hold on, stay here, and behind me,&quot; Neo draws an arrow.
We&#39;re downwind...so that must mean it&#39;s coming from the forest. I know the hunting party went that way, but certainly there wouldn&#39;t be that big of a catch this time of year., he thinks, before noticing someone running from the forest line, south of where they were at the abandoned home, &quot;Is that, Louis...?&quot; Neo mutters to himself, lowering his bow.
&quot;HEY! LOUIIIIS!&quot; Clay says, jumping out from behind Neo.
Neo&#39;s sense&#39;s suddenly screamed &quot;RUN!&quot;
Neo slung his bow over his back, picked up Clay and Alethia, and ran back to the village as fast as he could.
&quot;HELP! SOMEBODY! THEY&#39;RE HERE! THE FURIE-URGH&quot;
Neo glanced back and saw the child erupt into a spray of crimson after a dark shadow flew across his body faster than he could see.
&quot;NEO WHAT&#39;S GOING ON? DID HE SAY FURIES?&quot;
&quot;NEO IS IT TRUE? WHAT ABOUT OUR MOMS AND DADS?&quot;
&quot;I&#39;M RUNNING INTO THE VILLAGE NOW.&quot;
The sound of his heavy breathing as he ran faster than he ever thought possible was all the two kids he held could hear. Eventually, the village returned to view, with one end of it bathed in a frightening orange and red shade...the sounds of battle and crying permeating the land.
&quot;Someone....anyone.... has to be here that can help us?,&quot; he said to himself in despair.
Neo recognized a neighbor in the distance trying to flee with his family, he was about to turn to sprint towards them. Then suddenly, a dark humanoid form pounced on them...tearing the family apart in a grim shower of crimson. Neo had no choice but to sprint the other way, trying to keep himself from retching at the sight of another murder.
&quot;Neo, where are our parents!? It&#39;s dark!&quot;
&quot;I&#39;m looking I&#39;m looking, just don&#39;t let go, okay?!&quot;
Neo felt them nod while he carried them.
Eventually, he reached the town. He ran through what should have been familiar city streets....but the darkness and chaos made it feel like a foreign land.
He ran around, every second feeling like an eternity, his arms fatigued from carrying the kids.
&quot;Neo! Stop! Turn around!&quot;
A voice that had been calm all his life had cried out at Neo in worry and fear: his mother&#39;s.
&quot;Mom! Thank the Gods! You&#39;re safe!&quot;
Neo ran to his mother, set down Thia and Clay, and embraced her.
&quot;Yes Neo, but now&#39;s not the time. Look around you.&quot;
His mother stepped out of his embrace and reminded him once more of the dire situation, &quot;Your father is out fighting-&quot;
&quot;WHAT?&quot; without hesitation, Neo slung his bow off his shoulder, reached for an arrow, and began to turn to the flames.
&quot;Neo! Wait! He gave you a task!&quot; Neo&#39;s mother said, grabbing the hood of Neo&#39;s cloak.
&quot;What? A task? In the middle of all this? What could he possibly-&quot; Neo&#39;s mother yanked him close, and whispered to him.
&quot;Clay and Alethia&#39;s parents are out fighting as well. He&#39;s trusting you to take them out of the town and to safety in a city.&quot;
&quot;But...it&#39;s father!&quot;
&quot;NEO!&quot; his mother yelled, amidst the screaming and chaos around them, &quot;Please...listen to us and go to safety.&quot;
&quot;...&quot; Neo could only nod. His mother embraced him once more, and she said, &quot;I&#39;ll have to go tend to the wounded, here-&quot; she pulled out a small bag, &quot;Hold onto this, it&#39;s filled with things you may need, and these are for Thia and Clay&quot; she handed two more bags to them. &quot;Take Alpheus with you too&quot; she motioned towards the Greater Wolf pup at her side.
Neo nodded, trying to hold back tears.
&quot;I&#39;ll see you soon, my son&quot; she turned him around and sent him off.
Bags in hand, they set out, away from the fighting.
&quot;There&#39;s a carriage that my dad kept for emergencies, we can use it-&quot;
Neo nearly ran to fetch it, but realized it was likely taken for the fighting.
&quot;Nevermind, we&#39;ll have to go on foot.&quot;
They all ran through the streets, sticking to seemingly familiar paths.
&quot;Neoo! When can we see our parents?&quot; Thia groaned.
&quot;They said they&#39;ll be with us soon, they&#39;re just getting ready,&quot; Neo told a lie he knew he&#39;d regret.
The two kids silently followed.
Eventually, they reached the western edge of the village. All the fighting was taking place on the eastern side. There were a few houses still here.
Crunch
Neo&#39;s instincts kicked in, and he pulled the kids to the edge of one of the houses, backs against the wall, and he covered their mouths. They already knew to just follow Neo.
Neo looked around the corner of the building, watching as he saw a humanoid figure in a red-eyed mask walk in front of the house. It had the same scent a Fury had, but far too human, and lacked the same dark aura hovering around it.
What the hell? Now? Gah, I can&#39;t make heads or tails of who or what that is, He thought, looking at it.
If it&#39;s a person... certainly it&#39;s not a Fury. Maybe someone&#39;s trying to confuse the Furies by dressing as them. I can probably ask for help.
Hey poked his head out and said, &quot;Hey, uh, are you trying to escape to-&quot;
The figure reached out its hand, and suddenly the monsters Neo feared the most began to materialize behind it.
Neo grabbed the two kids and ran around the other side of the house, in pure panic.
ESCAPE, I HAVE TO GET OUT, I CAN&#39;T FIGHT THOSE, WHY DID I DO THAT, I CAN&#39;T DIE TODAY
Neo&#39;s mind was assaulted by a whirlwind of fear as he hoisted the two kids over his shoulders and ran. He heard the demonic cooing of rhe Furies begin, as they started chasing after them...he was their target.
He began weaving through houses left and right, the kids having not fully caught up to the situation at hand. All they know is they were supposed to be quiet.
He found a house with a half-opened door...thinking he maybe ran far enough, he ran into it to try hiding.
He barricaded the doors with furniture and shut all the windows.
All Neo needs to do is ensure he&#39;s covered all entrances, and the Furies might just pass by or simply make noise and leave. In order to stay alive, they must play dead.
Neo had his back against the wall furthest from the entrance inside the house, the two children beside him. He had his bow aimed at the door. Alpheus rested in Thia&#39;s lap.
&quot;You two are doing great...just stay like this and everything will be okay...okay?&quot;
They nodded.
Minutes passed, he heard the furies roaming around, a few rattles at other houses. Thankfully, their own house was untouched.
Having felt the danger subsided, Neo got up.
In that instant, his field of view was obscured by brick and stone dust, and Neo was sent flying back. He heard Clay and Thia scream, Alpheus howl, and demonic screeching.
In a daze, he laid slumped against the other wall for a moment, before looking up. He watched as that disguised figure stood in the place of the wall where they were just sitting at. It grabbed Thia by the arm, she tried to free herself, kicking and screaming, but it merely tossed her behind it, into the street that was now exposed, he heard her yelp as she hit the wall of the house across the street. Alpheus ran to her side, albeit having been seemingly injured too.
Neo raised an arm over himself, and started muttering.
&quot;...I bear all things, as does a mighty beast of the woods. My strength is unfaltering, my endurance is unending...I am-&quot;
Neo&#39;s healing incantation was cut short, as he coughed from the dust. He felt the effects, but it wasn&#39;t enough to be able to fight any of these monsters before him.
Clay laid beside him, terrified, &quot;T-Thia?&quot;
Neo watched as Clay was trying to get up. But he knew neither of them had a chance against either of these things.
He did the only thing he could do. He picked up Clay, and got up.
The figure didn&#39;t seem to do anything...its eyes however were a much brighter red than before...nearly glowing.
Clay weakly was trying to move to Thia.
Neo clenched his teeth. He sensed the house&#39;s structure had weakened dramatically. He could tell it was old. The wall to his left was starting to buckle. He felt behind him, a major crack was forming.
The houses in this village were supported partially by their construction, but also by runes etched into the walls. The blown-out wall in front of him meant maybe hundreds of runes were decimated. The slowly buckling wall to his left meant more were being destroyed. The crack behind him meant this wall was on it&#39;s way out too.
This house has no hope anyways, he thought.
&quot;&lt;SHOCKWAVE&gt;&quot;
He forced as much mana out of him as he could in the duration of the one-word incantation, and concentrated the effects on the wall behind him. A hole, big enough for him to tumble out of, was formed instantly. The house began to cave in much faster. If he could just circle back around fast enough, maybe he could save Thia.
Watching the house collapse, he knew the figure was trapped within. Once he reached the left side of the almost completely collapsed house, he set Clay down and reached for his bow. The bow had been scratched and bent a bit, but thankfully it was useable. He casted a spell over the arrow he held, and it began to glow a bright white. This was the one spell handed down in Neo&#39;s family. He drew back the arrow, stepped out of the corner of the rubble, and prepared to fire at the Furies that crept closer to Alethia. They seemed to be wary of Alpheus, strangely enough, who was barking and howling at the two of them. He knew this shot could pierce the heads of both Furies at once.
,&quot;&quot; Just as he was about to fire, he saw movement in the rubble. Terror returned to him in that instant, and he fired at the dark form that emerged instead. The arrow met its target and the figure reeled back in pain.
Neo, somehow, knew that wouldn&#39;t have killed it. He was too afraid to land a killing blow on something so human. He only shot its shoulder. He trembled. He dropped his bow. The furies were still focused on Thia. They began to crawl closer.
&quot;Thia!,&quot; Clay seemed to think that there was an opportunity.
&quot;CLAY NO!&quot;
Neo grabbed Clay and hoisted him over his shoulder, turning to the forest.
&quot;NEO WE NEED TO SAVE HER!&quot;
&quot;STOP PLAYING HERO! YOU&#39;LL DIE TOO!&quot;
Thia&#39;s injured form was laying on the ground behind them, Clay only could watch as the shadowy humanoid creatures crept closer to her, and as she got further with every step.
Neo was too strong for Clay to wrench himself from Neo&#39;s grip, but even then...Clay&#39;s fear would have kept him chained down.
Neo was running and kept running. He was running as fast as he could. All he really could do was run. He was no hero himself. All he knew was running. When he yelled at Clay for playing a hero, he was also yelling at himself.
Neo ran into the forest. He knew these grounds. A few hours north was a vassal city to the War God. Certainly someone there would help.
However, he felt a sharp pain in his leg, and fell. Clay tumbled a few feet ahead of him. Neo looked at his leg and saw a purplish chain around his leg, which was covered in spikes. They dug into his ankle as if they were teeth. In an instant, his body flew back in the direction he ran from, leaving Clay alone.
Clay had hit his head against a tree when he fell. The last thing he saw was Neo suddenly vanishing into the forest, and eventually, he passed out.
Chapter 0 - Memories of that unfamiliar face
&quot;Wake up!... -alive still.... Don&#39;t.... it end ..., boy!,&quot; a stranger says.
I&#39;m waking up. I remember my mouth was dry. My neck also was stiff from resting at the roots of that tree I hit my head on. I saw an old man wearing a grey tunic stand above me. He wore a blindfold.
&quot;Neo...Thia...where-,&quot; were the words I first spoke when I finally regained my senses.
&quot;Shhh...,&quot; the old man picked me up and sat him properly against the tree, the tree was rough.
&quot;You were badly hurt when I found you. Luckily, you made it. Here, have some soup,&quot; he said to me in that comforting voice of his.
The old man handed me a wooden bowl. It smelled good. The smell of freshly cooked food had distracted me from my worries, and I realized I was much hungrier than I expected . The food nearly scalded my tongue as I wolfed it down.
&quot;Whoa whoa! Easy! Nobody is taking it from you,&quot; the kind man had assured me.
When I had finally finished eating, the man asked, &quot;So, do you happen to have a name?&quot;
&quot;Clay!,&quot; I remember responding, the food seemed to have lightened my spirits.
&quot;Clay? My, what a fitting name, your personality matches clay.,&quot; he said, making one of his usual jokes about my name that he still makes to this day.
&quot;Person....Alley?,&quot; I responded(to be fair, I had no proper training in language or writing).
The old man chuckled, &quot;You seem like you could be anything, the world is your oyster, Clay.&quot;
&quot;Oyster?,&quot; I again responded; I&#39;m still not sure what these are.
The man shook his head, smirking and replied, &quot;Ah forget it...wait, I forgot to introduce myself. You may call me Grimstone.&quot;
And so the story unfolds...
I am Clay.

The road I take from our forest to the Wisdom Goddess Kingdom was quite safe. The forest we stay in is called the Elder Dragon&#39;s Bed, as an Elder Forest Dragon&#39;s corpse is the reason why the forest even exists here. Grimstone had predicted that the residual magic from its body should last the next thousand or so years. 

Beyond the forest are rolling plains which have received many names. Some call it Hyperion&#39;s Crater and other Ceris&#39;s Wake, which refer to the Calamities that Solus and Morrigan defeated, respectively.

A day&#39;s travel beyond that leads to the Desert of Scorching Sands, which surrounds the Wisdom Goddess Kingdom. I had to travel the border between the plains and desert for a few hours before stumbling upon an outpost that was selling passes to ride a Serpent Train to the outskirts of the Kingdom. 

I had a long conversation with one of the workers on the train about the serpents how the train works.

Sand Serpents, also called Sand Wyrms, are massive serpents that usually docile. They feed on bones, rare gemstonees, and magic items. They don&#39;t require liquids because they&#39;re held together by magic and not really considered &quot;living&quot;. If anything you would call them serpentine constructs that can replicate. They do so by using the magic from all the items they&#39;ve consumed over their life to form little gemstones, which become the heart of a new Sand Serpent. They form by drawing in surrounding sand and rock around them.

The way the the Serpent Train itself works is similar to a horse-drawn carriage. Sand Serpents typically only move by burrowing underground. However if you attach a bridle to them and attach that to a few carriages linked together, you end up with a good means of long-distance travel through the desert. This only isn&#39;t commonplace because Sand Serpents are very rare, and so very expensive. Their lifespans are said to be hundreds of years in length.

The Serpent Train took a few hours to reach Alexandria&#39;s border. We arrived at an outpost, where everyone was checked before being given permission to enter. Anyone who was not allowed entry was imprisoned temporarily and kept till the next Sand Train leaving the country was available. 

I had handed the letter Grimstone gave me to the guard at the post. He read it and wrote his own letter, which he placed in a magic circle and it was whisked off to who-knows-where. This kind of magic isn&#39;t isn&#39;t shared widely, and is actually very difficult to replicate. Some spells are national secrets, it seems.

&quot;THREE SILVERS FOR A NIGHT? WHAT A SCAM!&quot;

&quot;Yer gonna wanna watchyer mouth lad, I could raise it t&#39;four inna heartbeat, yeah?&quot;

&quot;You wouldn&#39;t dare.&quot;

The innkeeper reaches for his board and scratches a four over the three, without so much as a wince.

&quot;&lt;i&gt;Oh wow, you really went and-&lt;/i&gt; OKAY I guess I will settle for this place.&quot;

&quot;Sayyit, boyo.&quot;

&quot;Say what?&quot;

&quot;The name.&quot;

&quot;...&#39;The Bestest Greatest Inn Ever&#39;...I will be staying at &#39;The Bestest Greatest Inn Ever&#39;...&quot;

&quot;Oho, ya&#39;ctually agreed. I&#39;ll make it three n&#39;a half then.&quot;

&quot;Wait seriously?&quot;

&quot;Shuttup n&#39; take the room key b&#39;fore I change m&#39;mind. M&#39;youngest daughter came up wit that name n&#39; I&#39;m stickin&#39; withthit.&quot;

Bartering: Success...Not really. &lt;i&gt;But&lt;/i&gt; it didn&#39;t fail as hard as it could have? This innkeeper might have the thickest accent I&#39;ve ever heard. It&#39;s almost contagious.

As I walk into my room, I remember a rumor that it&#39;s cursed or something, or rather this entire inn is actually cursed. I agree...it has what our stall had. A terribly deadly case of &quot;Bad Name Syndrome.&quot;

The long trip here has taken its toll on me. The moment I hit my bed I completely knock out.

***

&lt;i&gt; &quot;Hnn...&quot; &lt;/i&gt;

My sleep is interrupted, I hear a noise from the window. 

[[It&#39;s a threat]]

[[I should just open the window and check]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="45" name="Chapter II-Call to the Crusade" tags="Done" position="550,1275" size="100,100">***

Grimstone used the reward money from Lord Necron to buy a horse and a wagon to ride back home. It didn&#39;t take too long to get back, and we mostly stayed silent. 

It wasn&#39;t a fun trip.

We arrived back at our cabin in the forest. Grimstone dispells the illusion magic with a swipe of his hand. I decide to go over to the nearby town to check if we&#39;ve received any letters or commissions through the Adventurer&#39;s Guild. There is one letter addressed to Grimstone from Aledxandria, oddly enough.

I return, letter in hand. Grimstone is pacing back and forth. 

&quot;Grim are you okay?&quot;

&quot;As can be...&quot;, he doesn&#39;t even turn to face me.

&quot;I have a letter here for you&quot;, I leave it on the coffee table in our living room. I head into the kitchen to brew up some tea: I think Grimstone might really need some right now.

I come back and Grimstone is sitting in his rocking chair. I take a seat on the couch, placing the tea in front of him.

&quot;Well Clay. It appears as if you are being invited.&quot;

&quot;Invited? To what? A party?&quot;

&quot;No. A tournament.&quot;

&quot;Haha, oh &lt;i&gt;totally&lt;/i&gt;. Reallllly funny. Lemme guess, the Crusades?&quot;

&quot;Almost, the tournament deciding the Wisdom Goddess&#39;s Crusader.&quot;

&quot;WHAT?&quot;, I get up out of my seat, &quot;You&#39;re delusional.&quot;

&quot;Unfortunately for you, no. My wits are quite present.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re joking then. Why am &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; being invited?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s what I&#39;m wondering. Regardless this letter is &lt;i&gt;quite&lt;/i&gt; legitimate&quot;, he says with an eyeroll.

&quot;But Grim...what about our debt?&quot;

&quot;Hm? What about it?&quot;

&quot;We need to pay it off no?&quot;

&quot;Oh that? I mean...&quot;, Grimstone shrugs, &quot;We&#39;re nearly done.&quot;

&quot;WHAT?&quot;, I slam my hands on the table.

&quot;FOR HOW LONG? I THOUGHT WE WERE ONLY A THIRD OF THE WAY THROUGH?&quot;

&quot;Uh...well...I do tend to make some money on my own sometimes...&quot;, Grim scratches his face while looking away, &quot;Listen, Clay. This will be a good experience for you. In fact, I&#39;ll have this be your final test as my pupil.&quot; 

&quot;Final test- What? No, certainly this is all just a bad dream&quot;, my head hurts from all of this. It&#39;s too much to process.

&quot;Also...it will be a chance for you to begin your magical research. Alexandria&#39;s libraries are filled with information and other things that will interst you...&quot;, he trails off, &quot;Clay. It&#39;s time for you to start becoming independent.&quot;

I don&#39;t know what to say. I really and truly don&#39;t,, I don&#39;t seem to have much choice in the matter, &quot;I...fine. I&#39;ll do it.&quot;

&quot;Awesome, here&#39;s your map, clothes are already packed, you ship out today. Good luck!?&quot;

&quot;Wait- WHAT? THIS SOON?&quot;

&quot;Unfortunately yes. You need to get there as soon as possible. Take this letter with you so they know you&#39;re a candidate for the tournament. Bye-bye Clay!&quot;

Grimstone hurries me out the door. I feel like he&#39;s kicking me out, even though I know that isn&#39;t happening...right?

All I can do is follow his orders.

&quot;But Grim,&quot; I stop for a moment, &quot;what about you?&quot;

&quot;I...well....&quot;, he looks around for a moment before responding,&quot;I have some...things...to attend to. It&#39;s just one of the responsibilities of being an older mage. You&#39;ll understand someday.&quot;

&quot;When are we regrouping? Surely this isn&#39;t a permanent split?&quot;

&quot;Oh, meet again? Hmmm...&quot;, he trails off once more. &quot;After your fist Trial?&quot;

&quot;First trial? You mean in the Wisdom Godess&#39;s Tournament? Oh thank goodness-&quot;

&quot;No. I mean as a Crusader.&quot;

&quot;WHAT?&quot; My heart nearly leaps out of my chest, &quot;A CRUSADER?&quot;

&quot;Yes. And pipe down already, would you? My ears are ringing,&quot; he covers his ears with his calloused hands.

&quot;Grim...your expectations of me are rather high? No?&quot;

&quot;Well. Live up to them, Clay...&quot;, he turns for a moment, &quot;...for all our sakes.&quot;

&quot;What was that?&quot;

&quot;I was talking about the vegetable garden,&quot; he points outside,&quot;I told you that last month I expected you to water them when we return. How unfortunate, the poor things are dehydrated.&quot;

I grab our pitcher of water and pour it over the plants.

&quot;Speaking of dehydrated...I&#39;m quite parched too...&quot;, he mumbles.

&quot;Tell me that earlier, please?&quot;

***

Grimstone waves at me from the cabin in the distance. This doesn&#39;t feel exactly real. I&#39;m not even sure what to really do in this situation. All I can do now is try and get to the Wisdom Goddess Kingdom. 

Grimstone let me take the horse, while he wanted the wagon. He said he&#39;d need it to take what he needs. When I asked him how he&#39;s going to pull the wagon, he replied &quot;I&#39;m an able bodied man! It&#39;s just a wagon after all!&quot; He then proceeded to pull it along like a simple wagon while sprinting in a circle around the cabin. The Old Man uses his strength for the strangest of things. 

[[Chapter III-The Tournament of Crusaders]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="46" name="Leave her alone" tags="Done" position="425,825" size="100,100">&lt;i&gt;...just leave her. I&#39;m not in any shape to have to deal with this.&lt;/i&gt; 

And so, I walk away.

--Back at the Inn--

I go up the stairs leading to the room me and Grim rented. Certainly Nadia is not back yet.

I open the door, finding the room empty.

&quot;I guess I was right, she didn&#39;t come back yet.&quot;

&quot;Your right, I only just made it back.&quot;

&lt;i&gt; Awesome! All I have to do is sneak back into bed like nothing ha-&lt;/i&gt;

A shiver runs down my spine.

&quot;H-hey Nadia....lovely weather today?&quot;

&quot;Certainly you wouldn&#39;t know, considering you were most certainly indoors during the time I had been absent.&quot;

&quot;Cut the crap. How long were you following me for.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll leave that to your imagination.&quot;

She prods me back into the room, and I slink into the bed. 

&quot;Well. I guess I&#39;ll just stay here then. Nice and cozy. No leaving. Nope. No ma&#39;am.&quot;

&quot;Oh don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll make sure of it this time&quot;, she pulls up a chair right beside my bed. She isn&#39;t reading a book. She just sits there...menacingly...

And so the afternoon passes by without much else happening.
***
Enough time has gone by such that Nadia has removed most of the bandages. I can move my arms freely now. Spells are still not doable, however. 

It is a few hours after sunset. 

&quot;Goodness...&quot;, Grimstone&#39;s tired voice fills the room as he trods toward his bed, &quot;That was a tiring day.&quot;

&quot;Welcome back, Master Grimstone.&quot;

&quot;Thank you for your work Nadia you may leave.&quot;

&quot;Of course Master Grimstone. I will be returning to Lord Necron. I will give him your regards.&quot;

&quot;Certainly&quot;, he says, before subsequently flopping onto his bed. I notice that there are a few Crow Feathers scattered all over his body. 

&quot;Did you get attacked by crows or something?&quot;, I chuckle at my own clever joke. 

&quot;Indeed I was... &quot;, he sighs.

&lt;i&gt; Well. &lt;/i&gt;

&quot;Did you find a good spot to set up shop?&quot;

&quot;Surprisingly, it seemed to have found me. I&#39;ll set up early in the morning tomorrow. Get some rest. Can you move your arms?&quot;

I wag my arms in response, still stiff. Grimstone nods, and turns over on his bed to face the ceiling, &quot;We have a long day ahead of us tomorrow. Get some rest now, Clay. Hopefully they&#39;ll be fully useable by tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t need to tell me tw- Oh wait, before that&quot;, I say, remembering today&#39;s events, &quot;I met a stranger in the city today who said she knew about the spot. Shouldn&#39;t we be worried she tells someone else?&quot;

&quot;I know, just forget her. You&#39;re better off that way. Speaking of which...&quot;, Grimstone sits upright, &quot;You left your room didn&#39;t you?&quot;

&lt;i&gt;Oh boy. Here comes the lecture. &lt;/i&gt;

***

After about an hour of me being told all the reasons I&#39;m an idiot, Grimstone heads to sleep. I pull out my book of myths, picking up from where I left off. Tonight&#39;s story regards The Offering and its origins.

There are differing accounts regarding how it started. However the central idea is that the Necron house once returned the weapon Necron to the Goddess Morrigan. This gift is a reenactment of that day. 

&lt;i&gt; It just seems like a scam...to earn more...money...&lt;/i&gt;

Are my last thoughts before I head to sleep.

[[And The Rite of Prophecy Begins...]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="47" name="Knock her off" tags="Done" position="1775,250" size="100,100">Grimstone would one-hundred percent knock her off.

&quot;YOU SHALL NOT PASS! `&lt;MANA PULSE&gt;`!&quot;, a pulse of blue energy shoots from the palm of my hand. 

The would-be intruder is hit. She briefly cries out in pain before hitting the ground. 

&quot;Cool now that that&#39;s done let&#39;s go eat-&quot;, I suddenly stop myself from walking away. I hear crying. I turn back around.

I see wooden splinters fly in the air. Something flies by my head and rattles on the floor of my room behind me. I look back and it is an arrow with some note attached. 

I don&#39;t see an attacker. 

I run to the window and look down, the girl is gone. I look around briefly and can almost make out the shape of someone or something jumping from roof to roof.

&quot;What in the world is wrong with this place?&quot;, I say. This whole situation is bizarre. I turn to the lethally delivered note and pick it up. It reads:

&lt;i&gt;Honored Warrior,
You have been summoned by her majesty the Wisdom Goddess to appear in a Tournament to determine who is most worthy of becoming the Wisdom Goddess&#39;s Crusader. 
Tomorrow at sunrise a carriage will be waiting for you to take you to the Temple of Divine Wisdom.
We eagerly await your participation. 
- The High Priestess, Nefaari

PS: Please do not delay by more than 12 hours past sunrise. We will consider that forfeit of participation.&lt;/i&gt;

Well this was a very important letter. Why the hell did they have to deliver it in such a convoluted manner? I literally have a door for a reason.

It&#39;s whatever. I toss myself back into bed. Hopefully I&#39;ll find no more interruptions.

&lt;u&gt;Synopsis&lt;/u&gt;



[[Start]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="49" name="Go look for the temple library" tags="Done" position="2050,650" size="100,100">metFiso: true
--
...go look for the library! Of course I should! I&#39;m in the Temple of Divine Wisdom after all. Where better to seek wisdom than a book.

I slowly open the door and tip-toe out of the room. I walk through the halls looking for anything hinting at some kind of library. The doors here are all roughly the same. It seems like this entire building is meant for residence. I guess I&#39;ll have to keep looking. 

I find my way out of the building and see one of the castle servants tending to the bushes outside. She wears a brilliant red cloak and seems to be looking at my room. Also it seems like she&#39;s beginning to climb up the tree adjacent to my room.

&lt;i&gt;....wait...what?&lt;/i&gt;

I take a step back instinctively, only to step on a twig. The moment I do so, the red-clad intruder seemingly flies at me. It appears I am her target now.

&lt;i&gt; Damn it all! Why is this place so filled with weird people trying to break into my room at night! &lt;/i&gt;

I slide my foot against the ground in an arc, projecting upwards a wall of rock. I hear her slam against the rock. Part of me worries for her, while part of me also wants to let out a terrified laugh at how she actually put cracks in my earth wall. 

&quot;It&#39;s Red again! Capture her!&quot;

I hear a voice from above. I take a moment to look behind me. Twenty or so masked figures similar to the intruder from last night have jumped from atop the palace to surround us. It seems however their target is &#39;Red&#39;, the one right in front of me. 

Red lets out a, &quot;&lt;i&gt;Tsk!&lt;/i&gt;&quot;, from behind the stone wall separating us. She leaps up onto it and looks at me. I can hardly make out her face in the night. 

She just pauses to look at me. She then whirls around and leaps onto the statue of hte Wisdom Goddess in the Garden, before leaping once more onto the palace.

Something about that moment... I don&#39;t know what it is...but it bothers me.

&quot;After her!&quot; one of the masked agents of the Wisdom Goddess shouts an order, and they give chase. 

&lt;i&gt; Seriously? What the hell is this place&#39;s problem. It&#39;s as if once sunset hits all the weirdos come out and start screwing around. I&#39;ll have to ask around about this soon. &lt;/i&gt;

I poke start looking at each of the 6 other buildings that are here. I see a young girl with black hair wearing white walking out of one of them with a book. That must be where the library is. I should probably ask her first though. I don&#39;t want to walk into the secret archives or whatever of this nation.

I walk over to her. The closer I get the more I realize she&#39;s really invested in the book she is reading. She&#39;s reading and walking at the same time. Talk about skilled. She&#39;s practically nose-deep into the book and yet still manages to go down the steps of that building without any real issue.

I&#39;ve reached the base of the steps of the building, and she&#39;s about to as well. &quot;Hey!&quot;, I wave at her from behind the book, &quot;Is that the library you came from? Can anyone go in or is it just scholars?&quot;

&quot;Huh-!?&quot;, she looks at me, puzzled.

&quot;Uh...good evening?&quot;, maybe I was too informal. This place is the Goddess&#39;s temple after all.

She just...stares at me, the look on her face is as if she sees her own shadow acting on its own. 

&quot;You...&quot;, she tilts her head and closes her book, &quot;... are speaking to &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt;?&quot;

Oh boy. I messed up.

&quot;Uh. Yes?&quot;

She looks off to the side, cradling her chin in her hand. Her eyebrows suddenly raise and then she looks at me, smiling, and says &quot;Okay then!&quot;, as if she came to some judgement about me. She continues, &quot;Well as for your question :no, I didn&#39;t leave the library. In fact I&#39;m on my way towards it with a book to put back&quot; she says handing the book to me. I take a look at it, &#39;&lt;i&gt;The Queen&#39;s Assassin&lt;/i&gt;&#39;. She started walking as I was inpsecting the book. &quot;Wait!&quot;, I jog a few paces to catch up to her, &quot;Didn&#39;t you say you&#39;re returning the book? Why&#39;d you hand it to me?&quot;

She keeps walking and says, &quot;Because you want to get into the Palace Library right? The least you can do is hold my book for me while we walk there. After all I have to unlock the temple doors.&quot;

Wait. She has access to the temple doors? Just who is this girl!?

Anyways we walk to the temple doors. They are inscribed with an ancient-seeming script and are plated in gold. The doors together portray a mosaic of the Wisdom Goddess in her signature position: holding a book in one hand. Legends say that the book she holds in that hand is filled with all the world&#39;s knowledge, and that every scholars&#39; writings put together would only add up to a single page of that book.

She reaches her arms out and a faint blue light glows from the eyes of the mosaic. The doors begin opening. 

&quot;What kind of spell was that?&quot;, I didn&#39;t even hear her cast anything. 

&quot;That was....&quot;, she looks around for a moment,&quot;...a secret? I myself can&#39;t really explain it, haha.&quot;

&quot;Fair enough.&quot; We walk into the temple together. The dim moonlight allows me to barely make out the appearance of pillars on either side of the center aisle of the temple, which lead to the 3 Veils. &quot;By the way&quot; I turn and ask her, &quot;&lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt; do you have access to the temple?&quot;

She looks at me, eyes slightly widening. She looks off to the veils for a moment thoughtfully. Then to me. 

&quot;Nepotism.&quot;

&quot;Fair enough.&quot;

We walk deeper into the temple. It almost seems like we are walking into the veils.

Oh wait. We are.

&quot;Uh. Are we allowed to walk here?&quot;, I shyly ask before going any further.

She almost laughs before saying, &quot;There&#39;s no reason to get so nervous! We&#39;ll be fine.&quot;

&quot;Okay...&quot; I say as the strange girl pulls the first veil aside. The space between the first veil and the second is laden with food offerings and gifts of jewelry. The veils are enveloped on both sides by the walls of the temple. She extends a hand out to the wall and the same thing occurs. Part of the wall rotates back as a hidden door to reveal a spiral staircase downwards. She claps twice, and suddenly a series of torches in the staircase are lit. She really knows her way around.

&quot;Well, come on!&quot;, she gestures to me. 

She leads the way down. It seems like prime time to ask her, &quot;So, what&#39;s your name?&quot;

&quot;Uh-&quot;, she takes a moment before replying with, &quot;Aya Fiso. Just call me Aya, Clay.&quot;

&quot;Oh okay. Wait a second-&quot; I stop in place and she turns around. &quot;How do you know my name?&quot;

&quot;I work here. I know the names of all our guests. It&#39;s part of the job.&quot;

&quot;I see. What do you actually do though?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m a librarian.&quot;

&quot;Ohh, so were you actually retrieving a book from someone that hadn&#39;t reuturned their book?&quot;

&quot;No no, that&#39;s mine.&quot;

&quot;It is? Oh right, you were reading earlier. What&#39;s so special about this book series?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;d take too long to explain. But if it&#39;s any indicator, look at how many volumes it has.&quot;

&quot;Hm? What? Does this have a lot of volumes?&quot; I take a look at the bottom of the cover.

&#39;&lt;i&gt;The Queen&#39;s Assassin: Garden of Roses (Vol 384)&lt;/i&gt;&#39;

&quot;What the-!?&quot;, I can&#39;t help but be shocked. The writer must be inhuman!

&quot;See?&quot;, she says proudly as we continue down. 

***
&quot;Look at all these books!&quot; I say as we finally make it inside the library. My legs are a bit tired from the trip down the stairs. She seems unphased, however.

The library is a labrynth of bookshelves extending out in all directions. We walk through the shelves and she places the book back neatly in an empty spot. I realize the bookshelf is lined with hundreds of these volumes of the book. 
&quot;Just how many volumes are there?&quot;

&quot;Well the writer who submitted these never was able to count them all. But the rumored total is near in the upper thousands.&quot;

&quot;T-THOUSANDS?&quot;

She covers her ears, &quot;Yes- Now please don&#39;t be so loud in here.&quot;

&quot;Oh right, scholars are probably doing work here.&quot;

&quot;No, its just us.&quot;

I look at her, &quot;What? Nobody is here? How can you be so sure?&quot;

&quot;Instinct?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s a fairly impressive instinct to have.&quot;

She nonshalantly shrugs and says, &quot;Well then, where to?&quot;

Oh right, I came here looking for something to read. Lets see...

&quot;How about books about Magic?&quot;

&quot;Magic you say...ah.&quot;

We walk towards the far edge of the library. The books here seem to be of much higher quality.

&quot;This whole area until the wall is all books on magic.&quot;

&quot;No wonder the magical scholarship here is so strong.&quot; I think about what book I&#39;d want to look into. &quot;How about defensive magic?&quot;

&quot;Defensive magic? I suppose that might come in handy.&quot; She walks along the shelf muttering something to herself and running her hand along the books. She suddenly stops and pulls one out. &quot;How&#39;s this?&quot;

&#39;&lt;i&gt;A Comprehensive Introduction to the Defensive School of Magic and its Principles. Penned by Manithes Horus&lt;/i&gt;&#39;

&quot;This might be exactly what I need!&quot;

She looks rather proud of herself. &quot;Some advice. Don&#39;t get too wrapped up in the theory of that book. It&#39;s overcomplicating the basic ideas.&quot;

&quot;Oh? You&#39;re a mage as well.&quot;

&quot;Well-&quot;, she stops herself from saying something before continuing, &quot;It&#39;s just some hearsay from people who&#39;ve borrowed it.

&quot;Oh really? I&#39;ll take that into consideration then, thanks. Also it might be a bit late into the night. Should we get going?&quot;

She nods and we head out the way we came.

We part ways outside the main building after she locks it. She heads in to the building she came from originally. I guess that&#39;s where the palace workers live.

I head back into my room. The guy next to me is knocked out. I fling my satchel under the bed and knock out.

What a strange night.

&quot;How about books about the Wisdom Goddess?&quot;

She just &lt;i&gt;looks&lt;/i&gt; at me...again. Did I say something wrong?

&quot;Okay then. Let&#39;s go.&quot; We head down the hall towards

I feel like I did &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt; but I am not quite sure what it is. Anyways it doesn&#39;t take too long before we reach the section on the Goddess. And well...how do I put it.

It&#39;s a mess.

There are books all over the place. Some half-open. Some with torn covers. You&#39;d think people would know better than to damage Temple books!

&quot;This is horrible! Who did this!?&quot;

&quot;S-Sorry.&quot;

I look at her in amazement. 

&quot;What?! You did this? Why? Isn&#39;t it your job to keep this place from getting like this?&quot;

She just seems to be embarassed. Perhaps it isn&#39;t my place to just call her out like this. 

I look around to find any books that aren&#39;t in bad condition. There&#39;s a book with a leather cover. I pull it and start flipping through. It seems like it&#39;s all handwritten.

While I skim it, I feel it suddenly get snatched out of my hands. 

&quot;Off limits.&quot;

&quot;Off limits!?&quot;

&quot;YES!&quot; She holds the book close to her. Almost like I stole her child.

&quot;Okay okay. How about something you reccommend?&quot;

&quot;Something I reccommend? What would I even-&quot;

She pauses.

She starts walking in the direction we came from. She goes to the right a few aisles and grabs a book. It seems rather old. She hands it to me. 

&#39;&lt;i&gt;The Queen&#39;s Assassin: The Fated Night (Vol. 1)&lt;/i&gt;&#39;

&quot;What? Seriously? This little book series is what you&#39;re reccommending?&quot;

&quot;Well the &#39;Queen&#39; is said to be inspired by the Wisdom Goddess. Frankly I think its a fairly accurate portrayal. If you want to get to know her, no better place to start.&quot;

&quot;Uh...sure&quot; I tuck away the book in my satchel. &quot;Anyways why don&#39;t we head back. I think it might be past midnight already and the competition is tomorrow.&quot;

She nods and we head out.

&quot;How about books about history?&quot;

&quot;History you say...ah.&quot;

We walk down a few shelves and she points to our right.

&quot;Over here are the books dedicated to history prior to the first Crusade. It&#39;s categorized as myths and legend. The further down the shelf you go the more recent and accurate it gets.&quot;

&quot;I see. Anything on the history of the Crusades?&quot;

&quot;Oh, that&#39;s an interesting ask. One second.&quot; She walks along the shelf muttering something to herself and running her hand along the books. She suddenly stops and pulls one out. &quot;How&#39;s this?&quot;

&#39;&lt;i&gt;An Eyewitness Account of the First 10 Crusades. Penned by Her Majesty Sofiya&lt;/i&gt;&#39;

&quot;Whoa wait the Wisdom Goddess writes books here?&quot;

&quot;Well yes! She&#39;s the Wisdom Goddess! What do you think she does all day aside from document her knowledge?&quot; She says, almost offended.

&quot;Okay okay. Thank you.&quot; I put the book away in my satchel. &quot;Since this is an important book and all. How would I return it?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll find you when you&#39;re done with it.&quot;

That&#39;s somewhat chilling. 

&quot;Right. Also it might be a bit late into the night. Should we get going?&quot;

She nods and we head out the way we came.

[[Clay Reads Something]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="53" name="Roam the halls" tags="Done" position="1550,625" size="100,100">I guess I&#39;ll take a walk around inside. People might be getting to know each other here. Forming alliances is crucial in these kinds of things from what I&#39;ve read.

I go through the halls of the residential building. There&#39;s actually a common hall here but nobody seems to be here. I have a feeling people will start coming here very soon.

I pull out my book of the nations and their lore. This time opening to the section on the Wisdom Goddess Kingdom. I look for a story I haven&#39;t read yet.

&lt;i&gt; The Monarch Mage and his challenge to The Wisdom Goddess 

Legends speak of the Monarch Mage, before having been given the title, in ages past having once challenged the Wisdom Goddess. He said that if he could craft a spell that she could not deconstruct, she must forfeit any book she owns. The Wisdom Goddess accepted, on the terms that if she is able to, he must serve in her court. The two agreed to these terms.

However, the Wisdom Goddess did not know that the Monarch Mage had conspired with the Moon Goddess Luna. They had made a pact that on this night she would make the stars vanish. The Wisdom Goddess, on having seen this, was dumbfounded. Try as she might she could not replicate the effect, having not realized the Monarch Mage had divine assistance. She forfeited. 

The Monarch Mage then made his request. He had requested the Codex Theoria which she had always kept hovering by her. She begrudgingly accepted.

Thus the Wisdom Goddess had to wait until the Monarch Mage had met his end in order to retrieve her sacred text.
&lt;/i&gt;

&quot;Ha! That Monarch Mage really does live up to his legend! To think even the Gods struggled against him!&quot; A surly voice says next to me.

&lt;i&gt; Well yeah I guess so- Wait...&lt;/i&gt;

A shiver runs down my spine. I look up and there is a tall tan man next to me. His wrists have large gold bands on them. His hair was cut extremely short and his pupils did not match each other&#39;s tint. He wore a large tunic which seemed to enshroud the body of a seasoned warrior.

&quot;Nakht! Don&#39;t scare the other competitors! The games haven&#39;t even started!&quot;, a woman says as she walks in from the hall

I take a look at myself in the mirror behind the man called Nakht. I&#39;m pale and sweating. I was so terrified for a moment that it didn&#39;t even register to me conciously.

&quot;Ah! Sorry Rey!&quot;, Nakht took a step back from me. 

The woman, Rey, walks over to Nakht&#39;s side and says, &quot;Sorry if my husband disturbed you. He&#39;s not exactly very good at socializing properly-&quot;

&quot;Hey! I heard that Rey! I&#39;m right here you know!&quot;

&quot;-...anyways...I&#39;m Rehema bute everyone calls me Rey. And this dunce of a man-&quot;, Rey elbows Nakht in the side and Nakht crumples a little, &quot;- is my lovely husband, Nakht. What&#39;s your name&quot;

&quot;...Clay. Pleased to meet you.&quot; Their dynamic is very strange. I can&#39;t tell who the real threat is. To put it simply: do I fear the dragon or the witch that manages to tame it? 

&quot;Oh? Introductions already? My my...society moves fast in the royal courts doesn&#39;t it?&quot;

I tilt my body over to the left a little to determine the source of the voice. It&#39;s behind Rehema and Nakht. A man wearing black silk robes enters the common area. He has a gold chain around his neck that holds a pendent in the shape of a star. He speaks once more, &quot;I do hope no alliances are being formed this early. It would be quite worrisome for me.&quot;

&quot;Seth! How many years has it been my good friend!?&quot;

Nakht walks over to him. Every step he takes causes the floor to shudder a little. Nakht reaches out a hand to Seth. Seth passes through him to get to me.

Wait. 

Passes through him!?

I reflexively get up and take a step back. 

&quot;Oh?&quot; Seth says, &quot;Have I scared you? Well well well... and here I thought the people of Alexandria no longer despised the Sand Wraith people.&quot; His hand started to reach for something in his sleeve.

&quot;S-Sand Wraith? What the hell?&quot; I&#39;ve been in this city many times and I have NEVER seen &lt;i&gt;THAT&lt;/i&gt; before.

&quot;Calm down Seth. He&#39;s a foreigner&quot; Rehema interjects.

&quot;Hm. I suppose so.&quot; Seth stops and turns to her. &quot;But tell me Rehema, has the Goddess stooped so low in recent years so as to invite those beyond the desert to have a chance to be her Crusader?&quot;

&quot;You and I both know it was the High Council of the temple that pleaded for this. Our last few games have been resounding failures.&quot;

&quot;Even so...&quot; Seth tilts his head, &quot;is it not the role of the Crusader to represent both the Goddess and her people? You must have gone mad if you believe a foreigner suits such a task.&quot;

&quot;Regardless of how we feel, this is our situation.&quot; Rehema sighs, shaking her head defeatedly. &quot;If you so wish to become the Goddess&#39;s Crusader I advise not playing around like you did last year. I understand the Sand Wraith people are not ones for competition but certainly aren&#39;t ones to waste both time &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; space?&quot;

&quot;Really? Since when were you one to provoke a rival?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m merely preserving the sanctity of the battlefield.&quot;

&quot;The battlefield is nothing but a den of snakes: nothing sacred within it. However...&quot; Seth takes one step forward, &quot;&lt;b&gt;that especially means you shouldn&#39;t tread so lightly upon it&lt;/b&gt;.&quot; 

The air started to get tense. I...

...will take Seth&#39;s side. It makes sense, no? 

&quot;Hey!&quot; I cut in, &quot;I might not be familiar with the Sand Ghost people-&quot;

&quot;...Sand &lt;i&gt;Wraith&lt;/i&gt;...&quot;, Seth corrects me.

&quot;-...right....anyways I&#39;m not familiar with them but I do think you&#39;re not preserving the so-called sanctity of the battlefield.&quot;

&quot;Huh!? You- a literal child -are lecturing me about the the honor of battle? Nakht!&quot;

The behemoth of a man...Nakht... walked behind Rehema menacingly...

And then....

&quot;Upsy-daisy Rey Rey!&quot;

&quot;Wh-WHAAAT?! NAKHT PUT ME DOWN!&quot;

&quot;Come now it&#39;s time for you to go sleep, this is what happens when you stay up too late.&quot;

&quot;Nakht you&#39;re embarassing me in front of your rivals!&quot;

&quot;Now now Rey. Don&#39;t get fussy.&quot;

And so the Behemoth and the Broad depart from the common hall.

Seth crosses his arms, &quot;Oh dear. I got a little carried away didn&#39;t I?&quot;

&quot;Oh absolutely.&quot;

&quot;Well that&#39;s just how the desert wind breathes I suppose. Anyways,&quot; Seth turns to me now, &quot;why did you side with me?&quot;

&quot;Hm? Well she seemed like she was wrong.&quot;

&quot;I see. Well I suppose an enemy of my enemy is my friend I suppose.&quot; He reaches a hand out to me, &quot;Pleasure to meet you. I am Seth Of The Ravine, and I believe we will be competitors in this competition.&quot;

&quot;I am Clay Of....&quot;, I realized I got swept up in his naming scheme. No backing out now. &quot;...The Ionian Countryside. Pleasure to be facing you.&quot; I try to shake his hand, but feel nothing. My hand passes right through, and I could not contain my feeling of discomfort seeing my hand fade into his as I try to grip it.

&quot;Pfft-&quot; Seth burst into laughter,&quot;Hahaha! Classic! Classic! It&#39;s been so long since I&#39;ve had someone fall for that! Hah!&quot; Our resident ghost...I mean wraith...seems to be quite enjoying this.
***

After sitting with Seth and speaking with him for a while. I came to learn more about the Sand Wraith people.

They claim heritage from the Sand Dragons which once roamed the deserts. Apparently one of the Sand Dragons took the form of a young male and entered a village, fell in love with a young maiden, and she ended up bearing a child. The child was not part dragon, however. The child was entirely human but had strange properties which seem to indicate the Sand Dragon heritage.

For context, the Sand Dragons were known for hiding themselves through mirages and only striking once they were close enough. Further, they were able to become incorporeal temporarily by becoming a mirage. They do not breathe fire, but rather a scorching hot wind that amounts to a wave of death that spreads in front of them. Functionally the same as fire: both kill.

The Sand Wraiths had the same properties(minus the death breath) yet the exact anatomy of a human. The other trait they earned was an extended lifespan of about 300 years, at the cost of a much lower fertility. They tend to mature into adults at the same time as humans, and remain as such until about 250 when they start to resemble the elderly more.

The title Sand Wraith comes from the tale of them being perceived as spirits when they go incorporeal. They tend to be offended by the term &#39;ghost&#39;, however. Some Sand Wraiths identify themselves as Sand Spirits. The most powerful Sand Wraiths are called Desert Winds. There are 9 Desert Winds at the moment. The head of the Sand Wraith people is called the Eastern Wind Kur Al&#39;Riah, or what translates as The Wind of Eternity. This comes from the fact that he has lived over 5,000 years supposedly. He&#39;s borderline impossible to meet, however. Some say he permeates the entire desert. 

It&#39;s quite an awe-inspiring legend.

However...this guy...

&quot;So then I was in the markets, right? My my, this story makes me keel over in laughter each time I try and tell it....heh-.&quot;

I brace myself for the same punchline yet again.

&quot;...and I go to shake one of the merchant&#39;s hands, and guess what?&quot;

&quot;...what. What Seth. What was it &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; time. I am &lt;i&gt;SO clueless&lt;/i&gt;.&quot;

&quot;My hand had passed straight through his! Hah! You should have seen the look on that gentleman&#39;s face!&quot;, Seth breaks out into pure laughter. I am unamused. Does this guy find nothing else funny?

&quot;Brilliant, Seth. You&#39;re quite the masterful jokester, truly. Have you always been such a remarkable comedian?&quot;

&quot;Well, this is my first time in the longest time actually speaking to others. I guess this is a natural trait?&quot;

&quot;First?&quot;, I respond, puzzled.

&quot;My? I guess I didn&#39;t tell you. I don&#39;t typically do much with my time.&quot;

&quot;So you&#39;re a freeloader?&quot;

&quot;Oh? How harsh. But you are right. I spend most of my time asleep.&quot;

&quot;What? Why?&quot;

&quot;Wellllll Sand Wraiths typically have no need to do most things, so we just sleep. We mainly subsist on the residual magic deep in desert ruins, and that doesn&#39;t require us getting up or working like the city dwellers do. Some of our kind simply sleep their lives away. A shame, truly.&quot;

&quot;...what? What do they even do? Dream?&quot;

&quot;Hm. I suppose. Our kind seems to have a general appreciation for history. The magic in these ruins depict the history associated with them in very vague and fantastical forms. It&#39;s almost like watching a play, or listening to legends being retold, from what I heard.&quot;

&quot;So how did you not end up like that?&quot;

&quot;Put simply: I can&#39;t dream.&quot;

&quot;What? What does that mean?&quot;

&quot;Wellllllll I mean I can imagine. But I can&#39;t experience these magical retellings of history from the ruins. So I end up simply closing my eyes and wake up in a different time in what felt like a second.&quot;

&quot;...are you like...okay?&quot;

&quot;As okay as one such as me can be!&quot;, he gives me a bright smile.

&quot;Well. That&#39;s good.&quot;, a yawn escapes me. I realize its now late into the night. &quot;I&#39;ll head back to my room now.&quot;

&quot;Oh? Getting sleepy are we?&quot;

&quot;I guess. Maybe you should sleep too?&quot;

&quot;Heh. I would, but I might oversleep and miss the trial tomorrow by a few weeks if I try to.&quot;

I nod and wave goodbye to Seth. Trodding down the hall.

It&#39;s a long walk down this hall.

I look ahead. Nobody there. It&#39;s dark.

I keep walking. Down this hall and to the left.

Keep running. Through the forest.

I look back. Thia looks at me.

I tumble and hit the ground.

I see Neo get taken away.

I&#39;m alone.

I will take Rehema&#39;s side here. I think she has a point.

&quot;Uh... I get you&#39;re mad since I don&#39;t belong here, and frankly I am too, but she has a point that this is just how life is now. Times are changing.&quot;

Seth crosses his arms, and Nakht pats him on the back, &quot;There there Seth. I know its hard to accept how much life has changed in just a year. For you it must feel like yesterday.&quot;

&quot;Hardly. It feels like it was just earllier today.&quot;

Nakht and Seth seem to be having a man to man moment. I&#39;ll leave them to it. Rehema seems to also be a bit peeved at the situation. I&#39;m guessing she doesn&#39;t really like Seth at all.

I&#39;m not exactly sure what I should be doing here. I think I will...

&quot;.....hm?&quot; I pull my blanket over me. It&#39;s awfully thin.

&quot;Clay!&quot; I suddenly feel myself be shaken about. The grogginess makes it hard to open my eyes. I manage to respond, &quot;What?&quot;

&quot;Wake up!&quot;

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;WHACK&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

***
I wake up. Nobody is there. I look outside. It is sunrise. Why am I suddenly stressed? Where am I again? 

Alexandria.
Tournament.
Right...

&lt;i&gt; OH WAIT THE TOURNAMENT &lt;/i&gt;

I try to get up but everything is sore. I realize my mattress was the marble floor of the hallway of the guest building. I fight through the pain and manage to get up. I hobble over to the common area. I see a small crowd of people. They seem to be competitors.

&lt;i&gt; Thank goodness...At least I&#39;m not that late.&lt;/i&gt;

&quot;Attention everyone!&quot; a voice says from the doorway of the guest building, &quot;The competition will begin by noon! Please be aware of this.&quot;

I look out the window, the sun is fairly high. Noon can&#39;t be more than 2 hours out. I think the best use of my time is just going for a walk. 

I stroll out into the courtyard. There are servants decorating the temple, tending to the gardens, and setting out food. I manage to snag an orange from a barrel. I walk out and wave at the guard at the gate. I&#39;m guessing he&#39;ll remember me, meaning no questions when I return. 

I peel the orange and eat it as I walk. All through the streets people are seeming to be preparing for the competition themselves. I see people all discussing the tournament. I walk towards a more crowded area. I manage to scooch my way into the front. It seems like everyone is betting on various competitors. I start looking through the list of names, each listed on a wooden plank. The amount betted is listed on a series of rotating wooden panels. It&#39;s a rather clever setup for depicting large numbers.

The top names are as follows.

&lt;i&gt;
1. NAKHT: 239 Million Gold Rings
2. SETH: 10 Million Gold Rings
3. PTOLOMEOS: 9 Million Gold Rings
4. LUCIUS(Foreign): 4 Million Gold Rings
...
&lt;/i&gt;
 
 I skip through, looking for my own name. As expected, mine is at the bottom.
 
 &lt;i&gt;
 ...
 45. ARS(Foreign): 4,000 Gold Rings
 46. CLAY(Foreign):  3,400 Gold Rings
 &lt;/i&gt;
 
 
 Seems about right. They don&#39;t seem to like the nobodies. And the fact that Nakht is the highest favored also makes sense. He certainly seems strong.
 
 Suddenly, my legs start shaking below me. I hear rumbling. 
 
 &quot;Ahaha! It looks like they&#39;re making the colleseum!&quot; Everyone is looking off into the distance. I follow their gazes and see a large structure start to form out of the sand. Everyone is cheering. I&#39;m having trouble keeping my balance. In a few seconds the commotion stops. I look at the sky. About an hour left until the actual competition takes place. Might as well head to the collesseum.

I think I&#39;ll go for a walk outside. Definitetly would serve to clear my head before the trial tomorrow. 

The cool night air washes across my face as I leave the guest building. The night sky twinkles and its lights reflect off the waters of the fountain.

&quot;Nng-!&quot; I hear someone&#39;s pained voice from behind the bushes.

I can&#39;t find it in myself to ignore the voice. I can already hear Grimstone lecturing me about decency.

I go over to the bushes near the Palace walls. Behind them I see a pool of crimson.

My soul nearly left my body. 

It thankfully, however, was not a pool of blood. I see a girl who seems to be wearing clothes covered in crimson. Was it blood? Was it the fabric itself? The two colors may as well have been indistinguishable in this light.

The girl tightens a bandage around her arm, holding one end in her uninjured arm while holding the other end by her teeth. She looks up at me. Her jaw goes slack.

&lt;i&gt;Quick! Say something funny.&lt;/i&gt;

&quot;Are you an apple that fell from a tree...?&quot;

She raises an eyebrow at me.

&quot;Because you&#39;re lookin&#39; awfully red and bruised!&quot;

She stares at me for a few seconds.

...

And a few more seconds.

...

Oh boy. She is still silent. I&#39;ll take this as my cue to remove myself from the situation. I turn around.

&quot;Ahahahaha- I can&#39;t! What in the Gods name is this! &lt;i&gt;That&#39;s&lt;/i&gt; the first thing you&#39;d say to someone in this situation. That&#39;s so stupid!&quot;

She seems to be unable to contain herself. Part of me is worried she&#39;ll wake the others up. 

&quot;-Ow! Damn it all.&quot;

I look back, she seems to have moved her injured arm.

Bleh. I should go over to help her properly, shouldn&#39;t I?

I step over the bushes, and kneel by her.

&quot;Okay okay whatever the hell you&#39;re doing, you aren&#39;t doing it right.&quot;

She frowns, &quot;I never recalled asking for your help.&quot;

I reach into my bag looking for something to disinfect her arm with, &quot;Too bad. You&#39;ve screwed up badly enough to need my help.&quot; I open up a bottle of distilled Tundral leaf extract.

She opens her mouth in protest, but I manage to douse her arm with it, and subsequently place a hand to her mouth. 

Why? Because she is now screaming in pain. I do respect the sleep of those around me, after all. Before she has a chance to fully regain her senses, I properly bandage her arm. Tundral leaf extract both induces an extreme pain response while also numbing the afflicted area. It&#39;s quite paradoxical. It speeds recovery immensely, however. This one bottle costed me a fortune. When you use Tundral Leaf extract you have to dump the full bottle, because once it is exposed to air it loses effectiveness very fast. I carry about 3 vials with me everywhere.

As I bandage her arm, I notice the assortment of jewelry she has on it. Insanity! How rich and stupid can she be? You&#39;d think such high strung upper class women would walk around with an escort. Her injury seemed to be from a knife slash. It seemed like it could be fatal if left alone. The extract should at least cut the recovery time down tenfold.

Once I finished, I look at her. She pushes me into the grass and her hand covers my mouth. I hear her whisper, &quot;One word and you&#39;re dead. Don&#39;t. Move.&quot;

Oh no. She&#39;s going to kill me for helping her! Dammit Grimstone! This is why I don&#39;t take your advice.

&quot;After her! Red is here somewhere! She won&#39;t last long! Isra managed to slash her arm. Keep up the chase!&quot;

I hear quick footsteps pass by. Then...silence.

&quot;...phew&quot;, she lets out a sigh of relief and her grip on me loosens. It took me a second to remember to breathe. &quot;Dammit. I have to report &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; now?&quot; she mumbles in frustration.

I&#39;m speechless. I legitmately have no clue how to react.

&quot;Listen. You happened to just get lucky that you saw me in this state and then foolishly went on to help me. I would have been fine!&quot;

&quot;Really? That was fatal! If you didn&#39;t have any Tundra-&quot;

She pulls out a vial of it. She had Tundral Leaf Extract the whole time. &quot;Too much of this stuff makes you dependent. You know how hard it is to train up healing rate!?&quot;

I&#39;m having trouble processing this.

&quot;It&#39;s not even like I&#39;m allowed to get revenge for this now because of His damn code of honor! Gah!&quot;, she kicks the bush besides us. Pieces of it splinter. She seems to have somehow dented the bush.

No words.

&quot;Listen! You better live long enough for me to get back at you for this! You hear me!&quot;

&quot;...Uh...sure. Who are you?&quot;

&quot;Who am I? Who am &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;!?&quot;

&quot;Yes I am asking who you are. Thank you for noticing.&quot; Couldn&#39;t help it. She was being dramatic.

&quot;ALETHIA!&quot; She practically yells. &quot;ALETHIA POLEMOS VI&quot;

&quot;Who?&quot;

&quot;THE SIXTH PRINCESS OF IONIA! DO YOU LIVE UNDER A ROCK?&quot;

&#39;No but I live with someone who has the brains of a rock&#39;, I would say but her not knowing Grimstone makes that joke lose its value. Maybe another day.

&quot;OVER HERE! I HEAR HER VOICE!&quot;

&quot;Son of a-&quot;, she turns around and breaks into a sprint accross the palace gardens.

This is too much for me. It&#39;s too late at night for me to be making rivals.

***

I begin walking back to my room.

It&#39;s been a long day.

The halls of this building wind a lot. Like the forest.

The halls are kept dimly lit by candles. Orange light flickers. The ceiling of the hall becomes the night sky. I hear fighting in the distance. The inhuman cooing of the Furies permeates my mind.

I look back. Thia looks back at me, the Furies surrounding her.

&quot;Why did you abandon me? Clay? You left me to die.&quot;

I have no words for her.

I continue.

I turn left here to go to my room.

I feel week. I stumble and hit the ground. The wall beside me feels like bark. I see Neo. His final glance at me. 

&quot;Clay...&quot; He reaches out at me, &quot;Why was it only you that escaped?&quot;

He reaches out once more before being pulled back into the forest.

I am alone.

[[Tournament Day One]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="59" name="Continue roaming the Halls" tags="Done" position="1575,1050" size="100,100">&lt;!--Clay will roam the halls. Though not as intense this dream will be far more insightful and detailed.--&gt;

I guess I&#39;ll just wander.

The guest building is quite large. I think it boasts 3 floors. I&#39;m probably just going to tour around this floor and head back to my room. 

I pick a direction and start walking. The halls are dark but I don&#39;t mind. They remind me of the forests back home. The orange light reminds me of the fireplace outside my home. Once, me and Thia caught a firefly that was orange instead of yellow. Neo was mad though because we were trying to feed it to Alpheus. To be fair, Alpheus would eat anything. That damn wolf was as ravenous as they come.

I run my hand along the walls. They feel like bark. The marble floor below me shifts into an earthy texture. I&#39;m in the forest again. I once followed Neo on one of his hunting trips with Thia and her parents. Neo managed to score a clean shot on a wild boar. He tried to show me how to take the shot but I never was good with weapons. Thia was a natural.

The dissonant noises of last-minute celebrations and comeraderie fill the halls. To me they&#39;re no different than the sounds of fighting...on &lt;b&gt;that day&lt;/b&gt;

I look behind me and see Thia.

Keep walking.

I stumble and hit the ground.

Neo looks up at me. He reaches out, before being pulled back into the forest.

I am alone.

[[Tournament Day One]] 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="60" name="Arriving at the collesseum" tags="Done" position="1600,1375" size="100,100">[note]
Sequence of events:
1. Clay gets in
2. The games are starting very soon
3. Game Starts:
THE FIRST TRIAL
The first trial is the Sphinx&#39;s riddles. Clay is in a team of 10 people among 3 teams. It plays out as follows:

Riddle 1: &quot;I have two arms, when one rises the other falls. When all is orderly, the arms are still. If a man holds my hand, he is deceiving you. What am I?&quot;
The team suggests
 - A Lever
 - A Woman
 + A Scale(From Clay)
 
This answer is obvious. The real choice is whether or not Clay will rush in and answer first. If he doesn&#39;t, then the second team will answer. 
4. After this Trial Clay has a chance to talk with some people
[continued]

&quot;Excuse me! Ah- Pardon me! Please can you just let me through! Thanks!&quot; I just manage to escape the crowd. I briefly look back and see a veritable ocean of people all wanting to enter.

&quot;You there! You&#39;re almost late! What in world were you doing!&quot; I hear a voice, a woman in a white silk tunic gestures to me from within the colleseum. She seems like one of the organizers. The guards step aside from the entrance to allow me in. &quot;Are you trying to get disqualified?&quot;

&quot;No?&quot;

&quot;Then get a move on! 200 paces down this hall and to your left! They&#39;re doing a headcount of all candidates!&quot;

&lt;i&gt;CRAP!&lt;/i&gt;

I break out into a sprint holding up a thumbs-up behind me for a second to show some gratitude to this woman.

---

&quot;Ars?&quot;

&quot;Present.&quot;

I hear their voices echo in the hall as they call out names.

&lt;i&gt;Faster! Faster!&lt;/I&gt;

&quot;Clay? Is Clay here?&quot;

&quot;PRESENT! PRESENT! PRESENT! DID YOU HEAR I&#39;M HERE!&quot; I just make it into the doorway.  I&#39;m exhausted, and just barely keeping myself standing after that sprint.

&quot;Please don&#39;t make a scene. Go to your designated team over there.&quot; The lady at the end of the room with a scroll uses her quill to point at the corner. I hobble over there and prop myself against the wall.

[if sideWithSeth]
&quot;Hmm? Decided to handicap yourself for the upcoming trial? Or is this just poor time management, Clay?&quot;

I look up and see Seth chuckling to himself.

&quot;Let&#39;s just say I underestimated the power of dedicated fans.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re in luck, at least. Today isn&#39;t the combat trial.&quot;, the lady with the scroll says.
[else]
The rest of my team is making small talk. I&#39;m just recuperating.

After a few minutes, the lady with the scroll pipes up.
&quot;Attention everyone!&quot;
[continue]

The room goes silent.

&quot;Today you will be facing the Wisdom Trial. In three teams you will be answering riddles which the Ancient Sphinx Ao will create. The two teams with the most points by the end win. Points are won by answering a riddle correctly.  Any questions?&quot;

&quot;What happens if there is a 3-way tie?&quot; 

&quot;A fourth question will be asked to allow only one team to proceed.&quot;

And with that, the horns are sounding to announce that the trial will commence!
---
The opening act to the trial was a brief show which depicted the legend behind where this trial came from. It lasted about an hour. 

The story goes that a Sphinx once ruled the desert and terrorized the desert villages. It then issued a challenge to the people of the nation that if it can produce one person who can answer its riddles, it will return to the desert. However if they failed the Sphinx would destroy 10 additional towns in that one day. The Goddess then created a recreated the Sphinx and tested her own people against it, sending the winner off to challenge the Sphinx, driving it off. That same hero went on to become the first Crusader of Sofiya.

The horns blasted once more. The cheers of the people were echoing through the the hall.

&quot;Single file line! Remember the bands on your wrists! Red to the right! Yellow in the middle! Green to the left!&quot;

We were being ushered into the arena. The desert sun&#39;s glare off of the sand made the arena feel like a different world. My team was about 10 people. I only recognized Seth, Nakht, and my ever-so-silent roommate. They were doing introductions for the candidates, my ears picked up on the names which had the highest total bets.

&quot;Next on our list is a warrior infamous for his deceptive fighting style! Seth of the Sand Wraiths! The Desert Demon!&quot;, the audience cheers.

A few names later, another one of the top names is announced.

&quot;A famous name among the villages! Ramses of the Hanging Village of the great ravene!&quot; A smaller group of people are cheering, but they are a very dedicated group. From the looks of it they seem to be his fellow countrymen.

&quot;From beyond the desert, a legendary hero from the mountains of the Serpent Valley! Lucius Skybreaker!&quot;

Not much cheering. Seems they don&#39;t quite like foreigners.

The announcer bunches up the lesser known names, which includes my own name. There is a pity-clap for the group of rookies. Tough being the new guy, huh?

&quot;The Goddess will now summon the Great Sphinx!&quot;

I look to the royal balcony. There also seems to be the 3 veils hiding the goddess. You can just make out her sillhoette from behind them. She appears to be sitting in a throne.She raises one arm. Suddenly the sand around us kicks up into a whirlwind. The hairs on my skin stand up. I drop my goggles down to try and see the traces of magic around me. 

It&#39;s practically blinding. I tear off the goggles while recoiling in pain.

This is the power of a God.

&lt;b&gt;&quot;I am Ao.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;, his voice rumbles,&lt;b&gt;&quot;Who dares challenge me?&quot;&lt;/b&gt; I hear many gasps and shrieks. The whirlwind subsides. There is a gargantuan being whose body is partially sand. The body was that of a lion. It had large wings like that of a bird, but the feathers glistened like sharpened metal swords. The head was that of a man, but the eyes were shining like small suns. The teeth each seemed like the size of a person, sharpened like spears. 

This wasn&#39;t just a creature. It was a monster. My legs nearly buckled at the sight. It towered over me like nothing else could. 

&quot;Great Sphinx, these noble heroes wish to challenge you.&quot;, the announcer says meekly.

&lt;b&gt;&quot;Is that so?&quot;&lt;/b&gt;

&quot;It is indeed.&quot;

&lt;b&gt;&quot;Then let us commence.&quot; He fans out his wings, forming a dome around the collesseum, nigh enclosing it. &lt;/b&gt;

His eyes glow brighter and hotter. 

The Spinx&#39;s mouth began to spew forth fire. 

It begins the speak.

&lt;b&gt;&quot;Tell me heroes? You are known for your great feats in battle,&quot;, in this enclosed area he formed around us we saw depictions of each of our feats before us,&quot;but do you know the basics of Wisdom? Tell me then, what is above speech, besides listening, and before intellect.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;

This one seems like it&#39;s deceptively simple. Perhaps it is...

The best course of action is the path of inaction: I&#39;m out of here.

I remove myself from their argument as steathily as I can. Maybe I&#39;ll read more about the Monarch Mage in peace.

[[Clay Reads Something]] 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="63" name="..sight" tags="Done" position="1600,1525" size="100,100">&quot;Sight! The answer is sight!&quot; I triumphantly declare! 

Wait. No I didn&#39;t. Who said that?

I look around and notice my roommate has walked towards the Sphinx. I could only guess that he&#39;s the one that just answered for us all.

I look around and notice my roommate has walked towards the Sphinx. I could only guess that he&#39;s the one that just answered for us all.

&quot;Are you a fool by birth or did your parents raise you that way! Explain this immediately, Ars!&quot;

That&#39;s one way to figure out my roommate&#39;s name.

Seth marches over to our teammate and reaches for his collar, when suddenly the Sphinx&#39;s voice rumbles once more.

&lt;b&gt;&quot;Indeed. It is an eye.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;

Gasps from the audience fill the air. The images in the room fade.

Seth&#39;s jaw drops and he takes one step back. Ars crosses his arms, returning to where he was standing amongst the team.

There&#39;s murmuring among the audience. I am starting to feel that many people are starting to regret some of their bets.

&quot;Well...it seems like the green team has earned themselves a quick one-point lead in the trial&quot; the announcer raises his arm towards us, and the green orb hovers above where we are located &quot;Great Sphinx Ao!&quot; The announcer turns to the beast, &quot;The heroes desire a second riddle.&quot;

&lt;b&gt;&quot;Very well.&quot;&lt;/b&gt; The area around us morphs into a street resembling the Old Man&#39;s Bazaar. &lt;b&gt;&quot;Heroes, suppose you find yourself on the streets of this great city, and you see two men arguing. The man on the right is a merchant, and the other is a customer. Between them is a boy with his hands raised up. The merchant is pressing the boy&#39;s right arm down, and the customer looks at the child shocked, clamoring about the price being outrageous. What does the boy represent?&quot;&lt;/b&gt;

I’ve needed to save Grimstone from being ripped off far too many times to not notice plate-pushing scum when I see them. That kid has to be a scale.

This time the team looks to Ars. He shrugs. I&#39;m guessing he has no other miraculous guesses to offer.

&quot;We seem to be in a predicament,” Seth says, shaking his head. “If we don’t answer this question, we might end up with more competition tomorrow.&quot;

“It could be a lever,” Ars suggests. “Look at how they are moving the boy’s arms.”

“The answer is a young goat, clearly. This is a common scene in the Ra’ashtari Marketplaces: two men arguing over the quality of a goat that one is selling.” A familiar voice pipes up. I see the young man who had been seen disciplining his bodyguard at the front gate just yesterday: Ptolomeos.

“Oh? Quite valid suggestions from the two of you. Though my senses tell me maybe it wouldn’t be best to rush into this.”

I&#39;m not 100% sure if I should try and answer now.

Looking at the other teams, it seems like they could each soon be ready to answer. Our team on the other hand...

&quot;You&#39;re a foolish plebian if you seriously think it is not a goat.&quot;

“A goat? Please tell me where goats have arms that swing up and down, I’d LOVE to know.”

“Why would two men argue over a lever’s value?”

“If one is buying a lever, would they not want it at a good price?”

&quot;YOU SON OF A-&quot;

Seth meekly raises an arm to suggest, “Could it be a weapon of some sort?”

Ars and Ptolomeos both respond “NO!” in unison.

We seem to have a little competition amongst our group here. I’m not entirely sure what to do immediately.

[[Rush ahead and answer]]

[[Tell the team my suggestion]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="67" name="Rush ahead and answer" tags="Done" position="1475,1800" size="100,100">
I shouldn&#39;t waste time thinking about whether or not to guess, especially since we have this lead!

I push the others out of the way fast enough for me to run to the Sphinx and yell my answer

&quot;IT&#39;S A SCALE! A SCALE! THE BOY REPRESENTS A SCALE!&quot;

I hear the group behind me erupt into outrage for a brief moment, when suddenly:

&lt;b&gt;&quot;Indeed. The boy represents a scale.&quot;&lt;/b&gt; 

The crowd erupts into confusion and disarray. Two upsets in one day. The realization that my guess was correct has not entirely hit me.

I&#39;ve just guaranteed our team&#39;s spot in the next trial. 

All we need to do is hope that the other teams miss the next question and all&#39;s well that ends well - for now.

[[Third Riddle]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="70" name="Third Riddle" tags="IN-PROGRESS" position="1625,1975" size="100,100">&quot;Great Sphinx Ao, we humbly request the final question,&quot; the announcer says to the beast.

&lt;b&gt;&quot;Very well then.&quot;&lt;/b&gt; The Spinx&#39;s wings fold back in. The face of the Sphinx no longer has the fire it once had. &lt;b&gt;&quot;Heroes, your kind is known for being engraved into history in the form of legends and myths. But do you understand the legends yourselves?&quot;&lt;/b&gt;

Myths should be my specialty, since I&#39;ve been reading books of legends for as long as I can remember. This might be an easy third point.

&lt;b&gt;&quot;Answer me this,&quot;&lt;/b&gt; the beast continues,&lt;b&gt; &quot;7 Snakes have bitten me with 4 fangs, I am now paralyzed. What am I?&quot;&lt;/b&gt;

I...don&#39;t have the slightest clue. 7 and 4 are common numbers throughout myths: sure. But I&#39;ve never seen myth that involves both of these numbers in a vaguely similar context.

It seems the other teams are sharing in our confusion. 

“I posit that it could be something about the death of the Monarch Mage,” Seth says,” That is just a mindless guess, however.” 

“The Monarch Mage definitely died in battle before the fall of the 7 Serpent Mountains,” Ars points out,”but information of his death is concealed. Even the Goddess Sofiya has admitted that it’s impossible to know how he died.”

Ptolomeos crosses his arms. “You lot are awful foolish if you aren’t thinking of the legend of the great warrior Huros who was said to be hunted down by assassins from the 6 nations and by his own brother. The number adds up to 7.”

I raise my book of myths, opening it to the section on Huros, “It says here that Huros died in a duel with his brother. Not against 4 assassins or 3 assassins plus his brother. The numbers don’t add up.”

“Could it be that we are misunderstanding his use of the word ‘paralyzed?’” Seth says.

The rest of the team keeps muttering to themselves.

---

An hour passes. The first two questions didn’t even take 20 minutes. I heard the whole trial should only take half an hour. So far the audience has started to leave the Colosseum. It looks like people are getting sick of the lack of action. 

My team has stopped sharing ideas. Partly for the fact we’re all out of them. 

Suddenly, from the Royal Balcony, a voice echoes throughout the Colosseum.

“Great Sphinx Ao,” the Goddess’s’ silhouette is standing now. Her voice carries with it a sense of intrigue and frustration. “Your	question has left our heroes puzzled for long enough. Give us the answer and let us end this contest. It’s a waste to just let time slip away at times like this.” It almost seems like the Goddess could not even guess this answer, based on her tone. 

&lt;b&gt;“Very well then.”&lt;/b&gt;The Sphinx almost seems to laugh at the development. &lt;b&gt;”The answer to the riddle is…”&lt;/b&gt;

All the candidates now face the Sphinx. The audience also seems to suddenly have interest again.

&lt;b&gt;”...Seraphus…”&lt;/b&gt;

That name. Silence rolls across the Colosseum. I can’t even hear noise from the city. Everyone knows this name. Everyone knows this story. The story of the Gods and Seraphus. We’ve heard it since we were all children. None of us could have possibly guessed it was Seraphus. 

Because even this doesn’t make sense. 7 Snakes? 4 Fangs? There are 6 Gods and 7 Seals. The Sphinx is spouting nonsense. Nothing here lines up.

The crowd starts jeering the beast. I even start to see stones being tossed into the arena for this. The beast maintains its satisfied look.

“Do you mean to deceive us, Sphinx?” The Goddess’s voice bellows forth from behind the veils.

&lt;b&gt;“Quite the contrary.”&lt;/b&gt; The beast gets up and looks straight into the Royal Balcony. It stares down the Goddess through the veils. &lt;b&gt;“I am the Great Sphinx, Ao. I only speak the truth. Do-”&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;”INSOLENCE. BEGONE YOU FOUL CREATURE!”&lt;/b&gt; The beast collapses, fading away into a large cloud of sand that fills the arena, before being carried away by a large gust of wind. &lt;b&gt;“The Trial has now concluded as the Sphinx has grown defective over the years.”&lt;/b&gt;

//THIS NEEDS TO BE FILLED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE VARIABLES
*“R-Right. As for the results,” the announcer nervously tries to get things back on track. 
*
\\

And so the Trial concludes. We are ushered out of the arena. I can’t help but look back up at the Royal Balcony to try and catch a glimpse of the Goddess. Unfortunately, the staff seems quite keen on ending this as smoothly as possible after the incident with the Sphinx.

IF TWO TEAMS MOVE ON:
Mention just that the losing team left
ELSE IF JUST ONE
Mention how the losing teams left and that the many thousands of people who sunk their savings into Nakht winning the tournament are now mourning because Nakht was on the other team

---
Later in the day, towards sunset, the remaining competitors were gathered in one of the larger halls of the palace. 

“Heroes! To celebrate the first trial’s success and to commend your efforts thus far, the Goddess has invited you all here for a banquet! She extends her congratulations and wishes that you all rest well for the subsequent events.”

On a large rolling table, a huge spread of assorted food was brought in for the remaining 10 competitors. Accompanying this though were many of the high-class nobility of the region. I’m guessing the event isn’t entirely meant for us. 

I start grabbing whatever looks good. The moment I turn around with my plate and feel the judgemental glare of a young lord as his manservant goes to get his food and must wait behind me. As I keep walking I see the maidservants of another lord laugh while glancing at me. I notice Nakht and Ptolomeos seem to be getting plenty of praise and attention. 

&quot;Careful.&quot; Ars&#39;s voice suddenly is heard right behind me, just as my collar is slightly yanked back and I stop in my tracks. I look down and notice another group of younger noblemen. The one closest to me has his foot right in my path. Having realized his plan to cause me to trip and fall has itself fallen flat, he retracts his foot with a glare behind me towards Ars. Ars continues, &quot;The nobility here aren&#39;t exactly kind to the lower ranking candidates.&quot; He lets go of my collar and begins walking towards the exit, food in hand. 

[[I&#39;ll follow]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="71" name="I&#39;ll follow" tags="Done" position="1625,2150" size="100,100">I guess I&#39;ll tag along then. No use trying to enjoy a meal whene everyone views me like an animal.

Ars walks out to the steps of the banquet hall outside, taking a seat with his food off to his side. I do the same, sitting next to him. The sun is still setting.

There is a burning question which I have been meaning to ask, &quot;So, why suddenly break your silence. You didn&#39;t seem all that social earlier.&quot;

&quot;I was tired.&quot;

&quot;Tired? Did you travel far?&quot;

&quot;I travelled nonstop for the whole night. I didn&#39;t have the luxury of Sand Serpent Trains to ride through the Desert with.&quot;

&quot;Oh? Did you have to fight anything to get here?&quot;

&quot;I had to fight everything to get here. The deserts are deadly.&quot;

&quot;You seem unscathed, however?&quot;

&quot;I learned some rudementary Life Magic from a wandering sage.&quot;

&quot;Oh really? That&#39;s impressive, most people rarely pick up Sacred Magic as is.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve picked up spells from three of the Sacred Schools.&quot;

&quot;3 of them? You&#39;re joking. Which ones?&quot;

&quot;Perhaps I shouldn&#39;t elaborate further, else I might give away my tricks.&quot;

I nod. I guess knowlege is powerful especially when its kept secret. &quot;Well, any reason you chose to join the tournament?&quot;

&quot;Nothing special, I just want money. You?&quot;

&quot;Hmm...I don&#39;t know.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t?&quot;

&quot;I mean, my teacher told me to join the tournament and win as a final trial.&quot;

&quot;Do you want this, though?&quot;

&quot;What do you mean?&quot;

&quot;Is this really what you want? Do you want to fight this tournament and potentially in the next, risking your life for something you don&#39;t have any real desire for?&quot;

His words were like a landslide of realizations. I&#39;m only here because Grimstone told me to be here. Why am I doing this?

I stare off into the distance. The city is bathed in an reddish light from the sunset.

For a moment, I remember Neo&#39;s face looking up at me before he was dragged away. 

I remember Alethia being surrounded by the Furies. 

The man in the mask. 

The fire. 

I was helpless.

I shake myself out of it. I realize my hand was gripping the bread on my plate so hard it&#39;s now misshapen.

&quot;I want to be stronger. That&#39;s my reason.&quot;

Ars looks at me in silence for a few seconds. &quot;That&#39;s honorable. You might just achieve that.&quot;

&quot;Do you really want money though? What drove you to fight for money?&quot;

&quot;What drove you to want to be stronger?&quot;

I keep my silence. The words get caught in my throat. I can&#39;t help but look down to hide my face.

Ars&#39;s voice returns, &quot;See, we all have our reasons.&quot; 

We continue eating in silence for a bit. The sun has totally set. The sound of muffled celebrations and music fills the desert city air, both from within the palace and throughout the city.

&quot;I guess we should head back inside and see what&#39;s going on?&quot;

I nod in agreement.

---

&quot;Sing-a-song of tales of old!
Of heroes, villains, gods, and gold!
Sing-a-song of tales of old!
Of legends, fables, and horrors untold!-&quot;

We walk into the main chamber and hear the sound of music native to Heaven&#39;s Gate, here in Alexandria of all places. In the center of the room is a bard, it seems, hired for the night to entertain the nobility. It seems a good amount of the upper crust is already drunk. I can see the palace servants swapping out the quality wine for a more common vintage. Classic.

&quot;PTOLOMEOS! PTOLOMEOS!&quot;

We hear a group of children surrounding a table where two of the Crusaders seem to be having an Arm-wrestle. It&#39;s between Seth and Ptolomeos.

Ptolomeos seems to be giving it his all.

Seth on the other hand seems to be downing a large glass of Ale with his other hand without a care in the world.

&quot;Wooo! I needed that! Oh, we&#39;re still playing?&quot; Seth turns his focus back to the game. 

Ptolomeos makes one sudden move to bring down Seth&#39;s hand.

The table snaps in half. Splinters fly and glass breaks. Ptolomeos managed to push his hand into the table.

His own hand.

&quot;Oh? If I remember correctly the only condition for losing an Arm wrestle was to have your wrist be pushed down into the table first. It seems like you have lost, therefore I have won!&quot;

Seth says, confidently holding his hand in the same upright position since the match began.

&quot;You freak of nature!&quot;

Ptolomeos is visibly agitated. The hairs on the ends of my arm start to stand. Sparks start to fly from his hair.

&quot;Oh Ptolly, mind your manners! Remember whose company we are in!&quot;

The air in the room settles, an Ptolomeos regains his composure. &quot;We&#39;ll settle this eventually.&quot;

&quot;Looking forward to it.&quot; Seth says with a smirk.. 

Seth looks back at me, &quot;Oh, Clay! My good&#39;ol&#39;buddy&#39;ol&#39;pal&#39;ol&#39;chum&#39;o&#39;mine!&quot; He pats me on the shoulder, &quot;And if it isn&#39;t the king of guessers himself!&quot; Seth extends a hand to Ars, who reluctantly reaches for it.

Wait a second...

I reach for Seth&#39;s hand. My hand phases through it. Ars eyes widen a little, and he crosses his arms.

&quot;Agh! You&#39;re no fun, Clay!&quot;

&quot;I have standards.&quot;

Seth shakes his head and sighs, returning to his seat.

Ptoloemeos seems to have vanished.

[[Head back to my room]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="74" name="Head back to my room" tags="Done" position="1600,2475" size="100,100">A large yawn escapes me.  I rub my eyes. I should proobably sleep early.

&quot;Ars, I&#39;m heading back to our room to turn in.&quot;

Ars nods. It looks like he&#39;s going for seconds.

I walk out of the banquet hall, and make it outside. The night is crisp

---

As I walk towards the guest building, I see the large group of candidates who lost leaving with their belongings. It&#39;s a rather gloomy sight. I head into the guest building and two of the servants walks up to me. One of them, a man wearing a white and gold tunic, says:

&quot;We have reassigned your room and have taken the liberty of relocating your belongings. This maid will see you to your room.&quot; The mentioned servant bows. I nod and go along with it. 

---

&quot;Breakfast will be served at sunrise, please return your prior room&#39;s key and we will hand you this room&#39;s key.&quot;

I reach into my pocket and grab my key. The maid takes it and hands me a new one. It&#39;s a very mirely sinute difference between these keys, I&#39;m surprised they can keep track of them. 

She bows lightly and says, &quot;Tomorrow&#39;s trial is the Magic Trial, at noon in the collesseum. Please head to the reception chamber in the collesseum upon arrival.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, thanks.&quot;

She walks off. The hallway is entirely silent, save for the echoes of her footsteps. 

I close the door of my room and sit on my bed. It&#39;s a slightly nicer room now. I&#39;m guessing this is meant for higher-class folk.

I pull out my book of lore. This time I guess I&#39;ll read about the Sand Wraiths.

[note]
This is where I would add some foreshadowy information about the weakness of sand wraiths, hinting at it being about sight while being incorporeal
[continued]

---

&lt;i&gt;knock knock knock&lt;/i&gt;

The sound of knocking wakes me up. I look outside. It&#39;s not even sunrise.  It&#39;s pitch black outside, in fact. I walk to the door.

The room is dead silent.

I hear scratching against the wooden door.

A demonic cooing.

An orange glow pulses from beneath the door. 

The smell of a burning village.

I open the door. 

A shadowy figure with two red eyes stands there. Its claws dig into arm. I&#39;m thrown into the flames behind it.

It looks down on me while I burn.

It&#39;s Neo.

Neo vanishes in the flames.

Now it&#39;s Thia.

Thia vanishes in the flames.

Now it&#39;s me.

The &#39;me&#39; in front of me kicks me. 

I&#39;m sent flying.

Helpless.

---

&quot;OW! Dammit.&quot; I wake up with my face on the floor. I fell off my bed. I get up and check the mirror in my room. There isn&#39;t a bruise or anything. Lucky me, I guess.

I start getting ready. Breakfast should start pretty soon. No time to waste!

---

I make it to the palace courtyard. It looks like breakfast is outside. The remaining competitors are out eating and sharing stories. I can&#39;t seem to find Ars anywhere. Perhaps he overslept?

I&#39;m still pretty hungry, but I don&#39;t really feel like making much small talk with people I&#39;m facing in the collesseum. The main meal looks like it&#39;s a sort of bean soup. Not my thing anyways.

I go around the palace, finding my way into the garden. 
 
 My breath is taken away.
 
 The garden is filled with flowers more vibrant than the most crimson of sunsets or bluest of oceans. Just the scent breathes life into me. 
 
 &quot;They&#39;re Phantom Lilies, they&#39;re native to Crowgarden&#39;s mountain, but they grow best in the deserts.&quot; A familiar voice says.
 
 I look around and find Ars behind me.
 
 &quot;I was just coming back from the market.&quot;
 
 &quot;Not a fan of Alexandrian cuisine?&quot;
 
 &quot;Nothing beats cuisine like my home country&#39;s.&quot;
 
 &quot;Sounds like you&#39;re from Crowgarden, am I correct?&quot;
 
 &quot;Guilty.&quot; Ars puts his hands up.
 
 &quot;I was just over there a little over a week ago.&quot;
 
 &quot;Oh really, then you must have been there for The Rite of Prophecy.&quot;
 
 &quot;Yeah, though we left early. My teacher decided it was for the best, and now I&#39;m here. Funny how that works out, isn&#39;t it?&quot;
 
 &quot;Did you visit any smitheries?&quot;
 
[if visitedSmithery]
&quot;Yeah, though I forgot which one...&quot;
 
&quot;Tombsword? Does that ring a bell?&quot;

&quot;I think so, yeah?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s still around? Hm.&quot; Ars nods to himself. 

[else]
&quot;I don&#39;t remember going to any, at least not this time around?&quot;

&quot;I see. Hm.&quot; Ars crosses his arms and tilts his head, deep in thought.
[continued]

The conversation is interrupted by my stomach very much audibly growling. &quot;Uh. Well. That seems like my cue to actually eat breakfast now. I&#39;ll see you soon, Ars.&quot;

Ars nods at me. I head out of the garden.

---

I&#39;m on the streets of Alexandria. The city is far more decorated today. I go to the same board to check the rankings today.

[if nakhtProceeds]

&lt;i&gt;
1. NAKHT: 300 Million Gold Rings
2. SETH: 100 Million Gold Rings
3. RAMSES: 77 Million Gold Rings
4. LUCIUS(Foreign): 92 Million Gold Rings
...
&lt;/i&gt;

As expected, people are doubling down on their orignal bets it seems. But now that the pool of people is smaller, I wonder where my rankings are?

My eyes scan down accross the board. I have to rub my eyes to berify what I&#39;m seeing.

 &lt;i&gt;
 ...
 9. ARS(Foreign): 3 Million Gold Rings
 10. CLAY(Foreign):  1 Million Gold Rings
 &lt;/i&gt;
 
 &quot;W-WHAT?&quot;
 
 My reaction grabs some attention. Thankfully most of the people who bothered to look were already drunk out their minds.
 
 I walk away from the rankings board, when suddenly someone comes up to me.
 
 &quot;Wait! You&#39;re Clay, aren&#39;t you? The one that answered the second question!&quot;
 
 It&#39;s a man who seems like he&#39;s in his mid-twenties. 
 
 &quot;Uh...no?&quot; I should have disguised myself. Why didn&#39;t I think people would recognize me! Dammit me!

&quot;Haha you can&#39;t fool me! That green cape is impossible to forget!&quot;

&quot;Oh, uh, this old thing? It&#39;s nothing really, haha.&quot; 

This. Is. So. Weird.

&quot;Talk about humble! Hey! I just bet a ton of money on you, so don&#39;t go and lose!&quot; He enthusiastically says.

&quot;Uh I&#39;ll try my best- Wait hold on how much money exactly?&quot; This man may have just made an absolutely terrible mistake.

&quot;Honey, please leave the man alone.&quot; The man&#39;s wife, it seems, has come to the rescue. &quot;And besides, his answer was probably just a fluke! Seriously you spend money so irresponsibly.&quot;

&lt;i&gt;&quot;Okay FIRST OF ALL screw you, lady.&quot;&lt;/i&gt; I say in the most offensive and annoyed tone possible...in my own head. I think I have to be mindful of my reputation now, because now I actually &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; a reputation.

&quot;Haha, it was nice meeting you both but I gotta run!&quot; I start walking away.

&quot;Wait but I have questions! Like-&quot;

&quot;Sorry! Have a great day!&quot; I pick up the pace and nearly break out into a sprint. 

People are SO exhausting sometimes. Running is too, but people are worse. At least I can avoid running if I really wanted to.

[else]

&lt;i&gt;
1. SETH: 277 Million Gold Rings
3. RAMSES: 98 Million Gold Rings
4. LUCIUS(Foreign): 65 Million Gold Rings
...
&lt;/i&gt;

It looks like a lot more people have started betting on Seth. Makes sense considering he was second-place before.

 &lt;i&gt;
 ...
 6. ARS(Foreign): 4.5 Million Gold Rings
 ...
 10. CLAY(Foreign):  50 Thousand Gold Rings
 &lt;/i&gt;


And obviously I&#39;m at the bottom of the rankings list. Woe is me. At least I don&#39;t need to deal with random fans.

Unlike somebody...

&quot;SETH! SETH! HE&#39;S OUR MAN! IF HE CAN&#39;T DO IT! NOBODY CAN!&quot;

The sound of cheering fills the city street. I see a distraught Sand Wraith run after me, &quot;Clay! Save me!&quot;

He tries to hide behind me, to escape his sudden fanbase.

An evil smirk creeps across my face. &quot;Come one come all! Get your limited edition autographs from Seth himself! First one to grab his cloak gets it!&quot;

&quot;Clay! You monster! I thought we were fr- WHAT THE!&quot; Before Seth has a chance to finish his sentence, his fangirls have already started their chase. 

&quot;Have fun Seth~!&quot; I say, trying to hold back my laughter as he frantically runs for his life.

Though, can&#39;t he just &#39;go ghost&#39; like he usually does? I guess panic makes you forget basic stuff. He&#39;ll figure it out.

[continued]

[if metAlethia]
As I walk through the city streets, feel like I see a familiar red streak out of the corner of my eye. My heart did a somersault my chest. I look, and all I see is a red tarp on a shop. Odd. What &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; that?

Probably hunger. I need to eat.
[else]
I continue walking through the streets, and realize I still haven&#39;t eaten yet! 
[continue]

It&#39;s actually hotter than usual. I packed lighter clothes before coming here, but maybe the heat is starting to get to me. 

&quot;Dragon&#39;s Blood! The fresh taste of mangos and strawberry! Don&#39;t be shy now!&quot;

I hear the voice of an elderly man. I look around and find the stall where he&#39;s shouting from. It&#39;s a small cart. The cart is stocked with various juices, but a lot of it is mango-colored. I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s his specialty. I haven&#39;t had mangos in a while. Might as well give it a try.

I walk over to the stall, &quot;I&#39;ll take one, the Dragon&#39;s blood, right?&quot;

&quot;Y-yes! Take it! Half price! Please buy one!&quot;

The man eagerly pours me a tall glass. I leave a few silvers on the table he has next to him. He seemed like he was only going to charge me one silver. I guess this can be my one good deed of the day.

I&#39;m handed the drink, taking a second to inspect the contents myself. The drink comprises of mango juice, with a splash of red coloring inside of it, seemingly from the strawberry extract he has on his shelves. Topping the drink are coconut shavings. This is a little more complex than the usual street vendor&#39;s drink.

I take a quick swig of it. &quot;Pretty decent drink, could go for another round of this right after.&quot;

&quot;You really mean it?&quot;

&quot;Of course. Good attention to detail, you have a table with chairs set up under the shade.&quot;

The man grins widely. He seems rather old to be working in the streets at this hour. 

&quot;Grandpa! Grandpa! We&#39;re back! We got more mangos!&quot; Two kids, boy and girl, run up to the stall, hauling small sacks each.

&quot;Did you! You&#39;re both such smart kids! You both take after your mother. Speaking of your mother, where is she?&quot;

&quot;She said she&#39;d be back soon, and told us to go on ahead.&quot;

&quot;Okay then, I guess we&#39;ll wait. Why not help me get some more customers? Use those bright little smiles of yours.&quot; The old man pinches the cheeks of the young boy and girl. 

I leave the glass on the table and walk off. This defintely helped lift my spirits before the trial later today. 

Though, it&#39;s already 2 hours till noon. I should...

What we want to happen:

Clay wakes up, this time he doesn&#39;t oversleep. The tournament is starting sooner because this is one of the longer trials. 

The same setup as before, Clay gets to the collesseum, roll call, the trial is explained. 

Then there is a short explanation of this trial in context.

The actual trial follows

Clay finishes his fast because he&#39;s an expert at fixing broken magic circles

Clay can choose to help Ars or help Seth.

If he helps Ars and Nakht isn&#39;t in this match, he will face Ars in the final. Same goes for Seth.

If Nakht is competing, and Seth is chosen, Clay will fight Seth. If Nakht is competing and Clay chooses Ars, Clay will fight Nakht(and lose).</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="76" name="...take a shortcut back, through the alleyways" tags="" position="1400,2600" size="100,100">...take a shortcut back, through the alleyways.

[if metMorrigan]
&quot;I sure hope I don&#39;t meet any information dealers with crappy nicknames again.&quot; I walk through the alleyway cautiously looking for anything suspicious.
[Continued]

I&#39;m fairly certain I&#39;m going in the right direction, at least. The general quality of the buildings is improving, which should point to me getting closer to the Palace.


After a few minutes, I make it out to a plaza, which splits into 3 directions. I look around trying to see if I recognize any buildings.

&quot;Sethenes&#39;s School of Blacksmithery&quot;

&quot;Kathor&#39;s House of Divination.&quot;

&quot;The Temurite Fine Art School.&quot;

I think I should walk in the direction of...

[[The Blacksmithery School]]

[[The House of Divination]]

[[The Fine Art School]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="77" name="..take the long way back." tags="" position="1800,2800" size="100,100">[note]

Long internal monologue. Descriptions of festivities. Clay reminisces on the events past. 

Monologue depends on past choices.

Clay arrives JUST on time.

- Alethia monologue
	
- Seth monologue

- Ars monologue

- General monologue

[[The Magic Trial]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="78" name="The Blacksmithery School" tags="" position="600,2700" size="100,100">[note]
This is where Clay gets there on time, but runs into Seth along the way. Seth is actually there because of a coincidence. He&#39;s talking with Sethenes, having a fun conversation about their shared namesake. This allows for extended dialogue. 

Ars will walk out from the Blacksmithery school 3 choices in.

Gets cut short 6 choices in.

This is where Clay goes and gets distracted by the fortune teller. Clay can ask a series of questons. After 2 questions, the diviner tells him he will be late for his trial if he doesn&#39;t leave immediately.

This is where Clay will walk for some time, run into some contestants who are running the other way, and realize he was VERY wrong about the direction. He will just make it and can merge with the blacksmithery branch

Clay will walk and walk yada yada yada and suddenly will run into Ptolomeos on the road. This is where you can have extended dialogue with Ptolomeos. Eventually the conversation is cut short 3 choices in because Ptolomeos realizes that he&#39;s behind schedule. He offers a ride on his chariot.
