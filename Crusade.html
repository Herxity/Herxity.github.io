&quot;CLAY NO!&quot;
%l003%

The young man grabbed the boy and hoisted him over his shoulder, running as fast as he could.

&quot;NEO WE NEED TO SAVE HER!&quot;

&quot;STOP PLAYING HERO! YOU&#39;LL DIE TOO, CLAY!&quot;

The young girl&#39;s injured form was laying on the ground behind them, the boy only could watch as the shadowy humanoid creatures crept closer to her, and as she got further with every step.

%l003%
The young man was too strong for the boy to wrench himself from his grip, but even then...the boy&#39;s fear would have kept himself chained down...

[Play Track &quot;Love Dream&quot;]
This is the story of a young boy who never wanted to be a hero, never desired to answer the call to action, never sought to save lives. 
This is the story of a young boy who, like clay, is molded into a hero: one who answers the world&#39;s call to action.
He once wished to live a normal life...
But normalcy is a luxury only a god could afford...

Indeed, there are many actors in this story, and they play multiple parts.
Royals, who sit on thrones of trust.
Fools, who were called to serve in their court.
Lovers, who love a catastrophic love.
A Court Mage, who must train the Hero.
Victims, who had their trust betrayed.
A Rebel, who seeks to overthrow the kingdom for their sake.
A Dreamer, one who dreamt of freedom since her childhood.
And finally, our Hero, molded from what was once a simple child.

At the steps of a rustic-looking abandoned home, in the outskirts of a small village, the excited voices of children could be heard amidst the sounds of crickets during sunset...

&quot;Neo! Neo! Tell us the story again!&quot;, a young boy with brown hair says to an older boy sitting in front of him.

&quot;Haven&#39;t you had enough already, Clay? It&#39;s the 3rd time I&#39;ll be telling you now, seriously?&quot;, the older boy responds exasperated.

&quot;No fair, Neo! You promised you&#39;d tell us since we explored the forests together with you to find birds yesterday with Louis!&quot; a young girl sitting next to Clay says, &quot;After all, you didn&#39;t want to go rabbit-hunting with us today.&quot;

&quot;You too, Thia? What&#39;s gotten into you too? It&#39;s the same story your parents tell you!&quot;, Neo says, &quot;Also, we don&#39;t want to get in the way of the hunters, Thia you have to understand!&quot;

&quot;Neo! You promised me and Thia! A promise is a promise&quot;, Clay crosses his arms, sitting down in front of Neo.

&quot;Yeah!&quot;, Thia follows.


&quot;Okay okay...you two are too easily entertained...&quot;

%t000%
%p003%
&quot;Wow, that War God seems so cool!&quot;, the young girl says, swinging around a stick as if it were a sword, &quot;but my mom says &#39;warrior&#39; instead of &#39;war&#39;. Hiyah-!&quot;

&quot;Hey- Quit it- Ow! Neo help!&quot;, Clay responds, being her training dummy.

&quot;Just be a better warrior Clay! Hah!&quot;, Thia jabbed at him.

&quot;Cut it out!&quot;, Clay said, &quot;jUsT Be a BetTeR WarRioR ClAy blah blah- oW!&quot;

&quot;UGH! Your voice is so stupid every time you copy me.&quot;

&quot;Its cause I&#39;m copying a stupid voice, stupid.&quot;

&quot;Okay okay, you two,&quot; Neo cuts in &quot; enough playing around. It&#39;s dark, we need to get you home.&quot;

&quot;Neo!&quot;

&quot;Yes, Clay?&quot;, Neo pauses as he was about to get up.

&quot;Will Seraphus really return someday?&quot;

Neo pauses and thinks, then smirks.

&quot;If she does, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll protect you&quot;, he says, puffing out his chest proudly.

&quot;Whoaaahhh!&quot;, the two kids&#39; faces were absolutely beaming at his reaction.

&quot;Okay okay, it&#39;s time to go, for real now.&quot;

&quot;Fiiiiiiiinnnnnneeeee&quot;, Thia tosses away the stick in her hand, Clay flinches thinking it was at him.

Neo picks up his bow, gets up, and starts walking down the steps of his house when he notices something off in the distance, &quot;That smell...is it blood?&quot;

&quot;Neo? You look worried.&quot;

&quot;Neoooooooooooooo, c&#39;mon I want to practice the sword more, are you sure we have to have to HAVE TO leave?&quot;

&quot;Hold on, stay here, and behind me&quot;, Neo draws an arrow.

&lt;i&gt;*We&#39;re downwind...so that must mean it&#39;s coming from the forest. I know the hunting party went that way, but certainly there wouldn&#39;t be that big of a catch this time of year.&lt;/i&gt;,* he thinks, before noticing someone running from the forestline, south of where they were at the abandoned home, &quot;Is that, Louis...?&quot; Neo mutters to himself, lowering his bow.

&quot;HEY! LOUIIIIS!&quot;, Clay says, jumping out from behind Neo.

Neo&#39;s sense&#39;s suddenly screamed &quot;RUN!&quot;

Neo slung his bow over his back,  picked up Clay and Alethia, and ran back to the village as fast as he could.

&quot;HELP! SOMEBODY! THEY&#39;RE HERE! THE FURIE-*URGH*&quot;

Neo glanced back and saw the child erupt into a spray of crimson, after a dark shadow flew across his body faster than he could see.

&quot;NEO WHAT&#39;S GOING ON? DID HE SAY FURIES?&quot;

&quot;NEO IS IT TRUE? WHAT ABOUT OUR MOMS AND DADS?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;M RUNNING INTO THE VILLAGE NOW.&quot;

The sound of his heavy breathing as he ran faster than he ever thought possible was all the two kids he held could hear. Eventually, the village returned to view, with one end of it bathed in a frightening orange and red shade...the sounds of battle and crying permeating the land.

&quot;Someone....anyone.... has to be here that can help us?&quot;

Neo recognized a neighbor in the distance trying to flee with his family, he was about to turn to sprint towards them. Then suddenly, a dark humanoid form pounced on them...tearing the family apart in a horrific display of crimson. Neo had no choice but to sprint the other way, trying to keep himself from retching at the sight of another murder. 

&quot;Neo, where are our parents!? It&#39;s dark!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m looking I&#39;m looking, just don&#39;t let go, okay?!&quot;

Neo felt  them nod while he carried them.

Eventually, he reached the town. He ran through what should have been familiar city streets....but the darkness and chaos made it feel like a foreign land.

He ran around, every second feeling like an eternity, his arms fatigued from carrying the kids. 

&quot;Neo! Stop! Turn around!&quot;

A voice that had been calm all his life had cried out at Neo in worry and fear: his mother&#39;s.

&quot;Mom! Thank the Gods! You&#39;re safe!&quot;

Neo ran to his mother, set down Thia and Clay, and embraced her.

&quot;Yes Neo, but now&#39;s not the time. Look around you.&quot;

His mother stepped out of his embrace and reminded him once more of the dire situation, &quot;Your father is out fighting-&quot;

&quot;WHAT?&quot;, without hesitation, Neo slung his bow off his shoulder, reached for an arrow, and began to turn to the flames.

&quot;Neo! Wait! He gave you a task!&quot;, Neo&#39;s mother said, grabbing the hood of Neo&#39;s cloak.

&quot;What? A task? In the middle of all this? What could he possibly-&quot;, Neo&#39;s mother yanked him close, and whispered to him.

&quot;*Clay and Alethia&#39;s parents are out fighting as well. He&#39;s trusting you to take them out of the town and to safety in a city.&quot;*

&quot;But...it&#39;s father!&quot;

&quot;NEO!&quot;, his mother yelled, amidst the screaming and chaos around them, &quot;Please...listen to us and go to safety.&quot;

&quot;...&quot;, Neo could only nod. His mother embraced him once more, and she said, &quot;I&#39;ll have to go tend to the wounded, here-&quot;, she pulled out a small bag, &quot;Hold onto this, it&#39;s filled with things you may need, and these are for Thia and Clay&quot;, she handed two more bags to them. &quot;Take Alpheus with you too&quot;, she motioned towards the Greater Wolf pup at her side.

Neo nodded, trying to hold back tears.

&quot;I&#39;ll see you soon, my son&quot;, she turned him around and sent him off. 

Bags in hand, they set out, away from the fighting.

&quot;There&#39;s a carriage that my dad kept for emergencies, we can use it-&quot;

Neo nearly ran to fetch it, but realized it was likely taken for the fighting.

&quot;Nevermind, we&#39;ll have to go on foot.&quot;

They all ran through the streets, sticking to seemingly familiar paths.

&quot;Neoo! When can we see our parents?&quot;, Thia groaned.

&quot;They said they&#39;ll be with us soon, they&#39;re just getting ready&quot;, Neo told a lie he knew he&#39;d regret.

The two kids silently followed. 

Eventually, they reached the western edge of the village. All the fighting was taking place on the eastern side. There were a few houses still here.

*Crunch*

Neo&#39;s instincts kicked in, and he pulled the kids to the edge of one of the houses, backs against the wall, and he covered their mouths. They already knew to just follow Neo.

Neo looked around the corner of the building, watching as he saw a humanoid figure in a red-eyed mask walk in front of the house. It had the same scent a Fury had, but far too human, and lacked the same dark aura hovering around it.  

&lt;i&gt;*What the hell? Now? Gah, I can&#39;t make heads or tails of who or what that is&lt;/i&gt;,* He thought, looking at it.

&lt;i&gt;*If it&#39;s a person... certainly it&#39;s not a Fury. Maybe someone&#39;s trying to confuse the Furies by dressing as them. I can probably ask for help.*&lt;/i&gt;

Hey poked his head out and said, &quot;Hey, uh, are you trying to escape to-&quot;

The figure reached out its hand, and suddenly the monsters Neo feared the most began to materialize behind it.

Neo grabbed the two kids and ran around the other side of the house, in pure panic.

&lt;i&gt;*ESCAPE, I HAVE TO GET OUT, I CAN&#39;T FIGHT THOSE, WHY DID I DO THAT, I CAN&#39;T DIE TODAY*&lt;/i&gt;

Neo&#39;s mind was a assaulted by a whirlwind of fear as he hoisted the two kids over his shoulders and ran. He heard the demonic cooing of rhe Furies begin, as they started chasing after them...he was their target.

He began weaving through houses left and right, the kids having not fully caught up to the situation at hand. All they know is they were supposed to be quiet.

He found a house with a half-opened door...thinking he maybe ran far enough, he ran into it to try hiding.

He barricaded the doors with furniture, and shut all the windows.

All Neo needs to do is ensure he&#39;s covered all entrances, and the Furies might just pass by or simply make noise and leave. In order to stay alive, they must play dead.

Neo had his back against the wall furthest from the entrance inside the house, the two children beside him. He had his bow aimed at the door. Alpheus rested in Thia&#39;s lap.

&quot;You two are doing great...just stay like this and everything will be okay...okay?&quot;

They nodded.

Minutes passed, he heard the furies roaming around, a few rattles at other houses. Thankfully, their own house was untouched.

Having felt the danger subsided, Neo got up.

In that instant, his field of view was obscured by brick and stone dust, and Neo was sent flying back. He heard Clay and Thia scream, Alpheus howl, and demonic screeching.

In a daze, he laid slumped against the other wall for a moment, before looking up. He watched as that disguised figure stood in the place of the wall where they were just sitting at. It grabbed Thia by the arm, she tried to free herself, kicking and screaming, but it merely tossed her behind it, into the street that was now exposed, he heard her yelp as she hit the wall of the house across the street. Alpheus ran to her side, albeit having been seemingly injured too.

Neo raised an arm over himself, and started muttering.

&quot;...*I bear all things, as does a mighty beast of the woods. My strength is unfaltering, my endurance is unending...I am-&quot;*

Neo&#39;s healing incantation was cut short, as he coughed from the dust. He felt the effects, but it wasn&#39;t enough to be able to fight any of these monsters before him.

Clay laid beside him, terrified, &quot;T-Thia?&quot;

Neo watched as Clay was trying to get up. But he knew neither of them had a chance against either of these things. 

He did the only thing he could do. He picked up Clay, and got up. 

The figure didn&#39;t seem to do anything...its eyes however were a much brighter red than before...nearly glowing.

Clay weakly was trying to move to Thia.

Neo clenched his teeth. He sensed the house&#39;s structure had weakened dramatically. He could tell it was old. The wall to his left was starting to buckle. He felt behind him, a major crack was forming.

The houses in this village were supported partially by their construction, but also by runes etched into the walls. The blown-out wall in front of him meant maybe hundreds of runes were decimated. The slowly buckling wall to his left meant more were being destroyed. The crack behind him meant this wall was on it&#39;s way out too.

*This house has no hope anyways,* he thought.

&quot;&lt;*SHOCKWAVE&gt;&quot;*

He forced as much mana out of him as he could in the duration of the one-word incantation, and concentrated the effects on the wall behind him. A hole, big enough for him to tumble out of, was formed instantly. The house began to cave in much faster. If he could just circle back around fast enough, maybe he could save Thia. 

Watching the house collapse, he knew the figure was trapped within. Once he reached the left side of the almost completely collapsed house, he set Clay down and reached for his bow. The bow had been scratched and bent a bit, but thankfully it was useable. He casted a spell over the arrow he held, and it began to glow a bright white. This was the one spell handed down in Neo&#39;s family. He drew back the arrow, stepped out of the corner of the rubble, and prepared to fire at the Furies that crept closer to Alethia. They seemed to be wary of Alpheus, strangely enough, who was barking and howling at the two of them. He knew this shot could pierce the heads of both Furies at once. 
&quot;&lt;LUMINOUS BO-&gt;&quot;, Just as he was about to fire, he saw movement in the rubble. Terror returned to him in that instant, and he fired at the dark form that emerged instead. The arrow met its target and the figure reeled back in pain. 

Neo, somehow, knew that wouldn&#39;t have killed it. He was too afraid to land a killing blow on something so human. He only shot its shoulder. He trembled. He dropped his bow. The furies were still focused on Thia. They began to crawl closer.

&quot;Thia!&quot;, Clay seemed to think that there was an opportunity. 

&quot;CLAY NO!&quot;

Neo grabbed Clay and hoisted him over his shoulder, turning to the forest.

&quot;NEO WE NEED TO SAVE HER!&quot;

&quot;STOP PLAYING HERO! YOU&#39;LL DIE TOO!&quot;

Thia&#39;s injured form was laying on the ground behind them, Clay only could watch as the shadowy humanoid creatures crept closer to her, and as she got further with every step.

Neo was too strong for Clay to wrench himself from Neo&#39;s grip, but even then...Clay&#39;s fear would have kept him chained down.

Neo was running and kept running. He was running as fast as he could. All he really could do was run. He was no hero himself. All he knew was running. When he yelled at Clay for playing a hero, he was also yelling at himself.

Neo ran into the forest. He knew these grounds. A few hours north was a vassal city to the War God. Certainly someone there would help.

However, he felt a sharp pain in his leg, and fell. Clay tumbled a few feet ahead of him. Neo looked at his leg and saw a purplish chain around his leg, which was covered in spikes. They dug into his ankle as if they were teeth. In an instant, his body flew back in the direction he ran from, leaving Clay alone. 

Clay had hit his head against a tree when he fell. The last thing he saw was Neo suddenly vanishing into the forest, and eventually, he passed out. 

&lt;h1&gt;Chapter 0 - Memories of that unfamiliar face&lt;/h1&gt;

&quot;Wake up!... -alive still.... Don&#39;t.... it end ..., boy!&quot;, a stranger says.

I&#39;m waking up. I remember my mouth was dry. My neck also was stiff from resting at the roots of that tree I hit my head on. I saw an old man wearing a grey tunic stand above me. He wore a blindfold.

&quot;Neo...Thia...where-&quot;, were the words I first spoke when I finally regained my senses.

&quot;Shhh...&quot;, the old man picked me up and sat him properly against the tree, the tree was rough.
&quot;You were badly hurt when I found you. Luckily, you made it. Here, have some soup&quot;, he said to me in that comforting voice of his.

The old man handed me a wooden bowl. It smelled good. The smell of freshly cooked food had distracted me from my worries, and I realized I was much hungrier than I expected .  The food nearly scalded my tongue as I wolfed it down.

&quot;Whoa whoa! Easy! Nobody is taking it from you,&quot; the kind man had assured me.

When I had finally finished eating, the man asked, &quot;So, do you happen to have a name?&quot;
&quot;Clay!&quot;, I remember responding, the food seemed to have lightened my spirits.

&quot;Clay? My, what a fitting name, your personality matches clay.&quot;, he said, making one of his usual jokes about my name that he still makes to this day.

&quot;Person....Alley?&quot;, I responded(to be fair, I had no proper training in language or writing).

The old man chuckled, &quot;You seem like you could be anything, the world is your oyster, Clay.&quot;

&quot;Oyster?&quot;, I again responded; I&#39;m still not sure what these are.

The man shook his head, smirking and replied, &quot;Ah forget it...wait, I forgot to introduce myself. You may call me Grimstone.&quot;

And so the story unfolds between the Court Mage and the Hero. Or rather, Grimstone and Clay. 

I am Clay.[Display img here]

&lt;h1&gt; Chapter 1 - Beginnings of Heroism&lt;/h1&gt;

Sunlight pierces through my dream, the first thing I hear is the sound of shoveling. Yesterday evening it was snowing outside our cabin, I bet the Old Man is trying to clear the snow from our vegetable garden. 

I  get up and yell through the window, &quot;Oi! Grimstone! Must be cold out there!&quot;

My master seemed startled. He takes a defensive stance as he attempts to figure out the source of the voice, before aiming his shovel at me.
&quot;Oh! Look who finally woke up,&quot; he says chuckling.
&quot;You&#39;re crazy&quot;, I respond,&quot; getting up this early and going out in the cold.&quot;
 He scoops up a shovelful of snow and raises it towards the window, &quot;Well you&#39;re coming out to help me dig out the snow unless you&#39;d like me to toss it into your room.&quot;
At his cold-hearted threat, I grab my cloak and head outside. The sunlight reflects off the snow strongly, my eyes take a minute to adjust. I veil my eyes with one hand, and with the other, I reach around the porch till I find the shovel. The old wood creaks as I make my way down to the garden.
[[I should ask about the Gods]]
[[I&#39;ll keep it to myself]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="I should ask about the Gods" tags="" position="3697,100" size="100,100"># Ask about that old story about the Gods

After a few minutes of shoveling, my dream comes to mind, &quot;Hey Grim, you remember the old story about the 6 Gods and Seraphus? The one we heard in the Wisdom Goddess Kingdom when we were tryna to sell at a carnival there?&quot;

&quot;That old tale? That&#39;s just what the Bards say&quot;, says Grimstone.

&quot;Whaddya mean? Ya don&#39;t believe it?&quot;, I replied, confused at his doubtful tone towards the legend.

&quot;It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t believe, but I don&#39;t necessarily see it as something to be believed either.&quot;

&quot;So you do or don&#39;t believe? Why are you being so wishy-washy about it, Old Man?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ll understand when you gaze upon this world with the same eyes as I do one day, Clay.&quot;

&quot;Old Man....you sayin’ I&#39;m gonna be blind someday too?&quot;

&quot;How many times must I tell you, child, I am not blind. I merely choose to not see.&quot;

&quot;Right, just like yesterday when you chose to let that scummy merchant swindle us out of a gold coin? You know how long we need to work to earn that back?!&quot; 

I clutch my forehead trying to calm my nerves. Thinking too much about money troubles makes my head hurt.

&quot;Clay, I tell you time and time again, money comes and goes-&quot;

&quot;Yes well, when it goes entirely, then the food goes as well.&quot;

&quot;Didn&#39;t you hear the part where I said we earn the money too? My alchemy has been quite profitable as of late.... let&#39;s see that is....&quot;, he reaches into his satchel and pulls out a small coin pouch, shaking it in his hand.

&quot;Twenty gold coins!&quot;, he exclaims with a smile.

&quot;And we&#39;re how much in debt again?&quot;

&quot;Two thousand.&quot;, the old man replies plainly, the smile fading.

&quot;So basically, we got less than negative nineteen hundred coins to our name. This really isn&#39;t our money to be losing, Old Man.&quot;

&quot;You worry too much. Anyways, keep shoveling, this snow won&#39;t clear from our walkway itself.&quot;

I look sideways at him, squinting, &quot;Wait. Do you not have fire magic?&quot;

&quot;Yes? What of it?&quot;

I rest my head against the shovel, trying to maintain my composure, &quot;Well, why not....I dunno, crazy idea....but maybe, just maybe.....USE IT?!&quot;

I may or may not have lost my composure.

&quot;Ah, but that takes the merit and joy out of the process.&quot;

I roll my eyes and continue plowing through the snow.

[[We finish shoveling...]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="I&#39;ll keep it to myself" tags="" position="4099,98" size="100,100">Some time passes, and we&#39;ve been shoveling in relative silence.
Eventually Grimstone speaks up, &quot;Well Clay, I must say, lately you&#39;ve started become very capable.&quot;
&quot;What does that mean...?&quot;
&quot;It means, I think you&#39;ve reached the age where you can finally care for yourself: in terms of magical education.&quot;
Oh good. I thought he was going to kick me out, I&#39;ve broken his windows more times than I can count lately.
&quot;Really? Does this mean you won&#39;t be teaching me anymore?&quot;
&quot;That is correct. I took you in and promised I&#39;d teach you the fundamentals of magic, but now that you&#39;ve come this far, I think you can start conducting your own research.&quot;
Research!?
&quot;Research?!&quot;
&quot;Yes, research. Of course, you don&#39;t need to start off creating your own spells or schools of magic, you could start off with something as simple as reading on a class of spells you&#39;re unfamiliar with. Either way, you&#39;re now primed to teach yourself from now on.&quot;
&quot;Teach myself? What? C&#39;mon Grim, you&#39;re not that old, surely you can keep going.&quot;
&quot;No no Clay, that is definitely not the issue&quot;, Grim responds shaking his head,&quot;This is all a part of you maturing. You need to learn to survive on your own. You have all the skills now, but now you need to practice doing it.&quot;
&quot;I guess&quot;, Grim&#39;s reasoning seems untouchable
&#39;&#39;Grim and Clay keep discussing research here&#39;&#39;
[[We finish shoveling...]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="...draw my sword and strike" tags="" position="3716,500" size="100,100">Of course I need to attack, we&#39;re near the Serpent Valley. The monsters here are leagues above your average skeleton.

I reach for my sword. Even disoriented, I&#39;d know where it is. I swing it out in an arc in front of me, but it bounces off with a *CLANG.* I lost my grip on the blade and it flew somewhere.

I channel energy to my hands. 

It doesn&#39;t matter what&#39;s in front of me. I have to kill it. I need to kill it before it kills me.

&quot;Lay waste to my enemies, &lt;FLAMING WIND&gt;-&quot;

&quot;CLAY GET A HOLD OF YOURSELF, CHILD!&quot;

I cut the activation short. The Old Man&#39;s voice echos through the cave. My eyes feel like they have started to adjust to the darkness, and I make out the vague shape of a man with misshapen hair. 

&quot;Clay, I told you not to fly blind&quot;, I can hear him shaking his head from his voice. I feel him grab my arm and drag me up.

He casts healing spells on me, and all I can do is mutter, trying to think of something to say. I still haven&#39;t mastered fighting without sight as he can. I&#39;m not even a novice. Moving without sight is not even feasible for me. How am I supposed to advance? I&#39;m a capable fighter, but unless I can do what seems impossible, what&#39;s left?

&quot;Clay...&quot;, his voice bears down on me. 

Oh boy....I&#39;m in for it, aren&#39;t I....?
&quot;Y-yes?&quot;
&quot;No more using the &lt;Blind Leap&gt;, got it? It&#39;s still beyond your skill range.&quot;
&quot;B-...fine.&quot;

I can&#39;t seem to defend myself. Grimstone&#39;s techniques are still leagues ahead of mine. 

&quot;Hm...What an interesting Cave.&quot;
&quot;What&#39;s so special about it?&quot;

&quot;The way it winds downwards and around, it seems to go on in circles and twisting, and it seems like it reaches the surface at another point here. The mine seems to really start at the lowest point.&quot;
&quot;Didn&#39;t Seraphus once fight Morrigan here? She could&#39;ve dug into the ground and formed the tunnels with her body while slithering through the rocks.&quot;

&quot;Perhaps...but if so....there seems to be an eerie lack of monsters here.&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s be thankful that there is an eerie lack of monsters.&quot;

After a few minutes, Grimstone pipes up, &quot;Well, I believe the lower levels of the mine should begin right here.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;re you talking about there&#39;s nothing there it&#39;s just more ro-&quot;

He takes his staff and props it against a boulder, pushing it aside effortlessly, revealing a stretch of tunnels that seem much more man-made. 

I&#39;m dumbfounded.

&quot;Clay, remember your breathing incantations. The air down here likely is not pure.&quot;

&quot;Yes yes...*Oh wind that breathes life to those who accept it, become as a veil to guard me against impurity. Let my words speak peace and my chest bear life. The wind holds with it the stories of our ancestors, the tales of heroism, of failure, of life, of death....&quot;*

The only sound that fills the cave are our footsteps, and the muttering of the near-endless incantation.

As we continue to walk through the cave, I notice the sparkling of some gems. These aren&#39;t useful gems, however. The most common crystal, Earth Mica, is flimsy yet has a distinct shine to it. It has no real use...speaking of useless...

&quot;Hey Grimstone?&quot;

&quot;Why do I feel like you&#39;re secretly mocking me?&quot;

Dammit, he saw right through me. Well he&#39;s blind so...heard through me? Sensed through me? Tasted through me? Smelled through me? I shrug, pointing at the stretch of tunnels before us, &quot;Mockery aside-&quot;

&quot;So you were-?&quot;,  he turns towards me suddenly.

I continue, &quot;-how much further do we need to go?&quot;

&quot;Tsk,&quot; he wacks his staff against the floor and waits a moment, &quot;about 30 steps this way&quot;, he takes a turn at a fork in the tunnel that I hadn&#39;t even noticed. I begin counting steps.

&quot;Here we are,&quot; he stretches his arms out, pointing towards something in the darkness up ahead.

&quot;-No reaction? Oh it must be dark then.&quot;

Right on the money. He creates a small flame at the end of his finger, then condenses it into a shining orb, increasing the intensity. Shielding my eyes from the light source itself, I begin to see red gems all across the ground and cave walls.

MONEY.

ALL I SEE IS MONEY.

WE WILL FINALLY BE OUT OF DEBT.

AND THIS IS ENOUGH TO LIVE IN LUXURY.

*rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh*

&quot;Grim was that you?&quot;

&quot;No...?&quot;

I feel a knot form in my chest, as I look towards the large cave chamber.

The area seems large and mostly vacant in the middle. There is a large mass of shifting stones there but nothing else.

Wait.

Shifting stones?

&quot;Grimstone is that aURHG-&quot;, something yanks me off to the side.

Where I was standing, a spike made of red crystal took its place, Grimstone pulled me away by my collar.

&quot;...Crystal dragon, and a strong one too, it seems.&quot;

The shifting mass of stones in the middle of the room begins to form into a ferocious lizard-like creature, with a face resembling a rhinoceros, but broader and more like a shield. The back is covered in spiked crystals, along with a swinging tail whose end is a dense mass of rock with spikes of the same kind. The front of this creature seems to be adorned in crystalline armor.

Grimstone thinks it over, &quot;If there&#39;s a Crystal Dragon here, that means that the crystals here are all the unusable...except...&quot;

I gesture towards him to continue, I don&#39;t want to cut off my breathing incantation.

&quot;The dragon&#39;s horn, on its nose. The only crystal that won&#39;t cause any real harm to anything...aside from us if it hits us.&quot;

We should...

[[Risk It]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="Risk It" tags="" position="3895,601" size="100,100">Risk? Pfft. I&#39;ve fought tougher opponents.

Namely, Grimstone.

I tug on Grimstone&#39;s sleeve, he knows I want to fight it.

The Dragon is settling into it&#39;s form, we have a few more seconds before it starts charging at us.

&quot;...don&#39;t do anything foolish, understood?&quot;

I nod.

We split up, I begin running from the right down a sloped section of the cave room alongside the wall, and hide behind a Stalagmite of red Crystal. I have to make sure I don&#39;t touch the crystal, they cause serious burns. The Dragon seems to be facing Grimstone. I&#39;m on its right side now.

The plan is to get to flank it, and hit the weak points in it&#39;s armor. Easier said than done.

&quot;*&lt;Earth Spire&gt;*!&quot;

A spike of rock slams diagonally up and into the side of the Crystal Dragon, but the rock crumbles on impact. 

&quot;***GRAWWWWWHHH**!!!&quot;*

We may have angered it. 

It begins charging in the direction of Grimstone, who begins to charge at it also.

That fool has no idea how dangerous that is. Charging straight at Grimstone? Worst decision you could make.

Right as they are about to collide, the Dragon swings its head up to attempt to screwer Grimstone, but he seemingly vanishes. 

Grimstone&#39;s not on the ground.

I look up, he wasn&#39;t tossed into the cave ceiling either.

&quot;AHAAHA, YOU HAVE SOME FIGHT IN YA, OLD SPORT?&quot;

Grimstone says, clinging to the Dragon&#39;s horn.

The Dragon seems to be enraged at this development, and begins flailing it&#39;s face around.

That&#39;s my queue, I grab the charm attached to my necklace, and pour mana into it. My lungs suddenly expand, and I start chanting.

&quot;*Oh unceasing tide that flows through the world, open your floodgates upon my enemies, and let the ocean&#39;s majesty be made manifest, &lt;Water Surge&gt;!&quot;*

As I conclude the chant, I leap out from behind the stalagmite, and aim my hand at the Crystal Dragon.

*3....2....1....Release!*

A massive torrent of water shoots from my hand, the Crystal Dragon is engulfed in it, and Grimstone casts his spell in response,&quot;&lt;Thousand Tundra&gt;!&quot;

A chill ran through my body as I watched icy frost envelop the Crystal Dragon. Its body began to slowly crack and split, the light in its eyes faded. I took a look at myself: I was shivering, and the hairs on my arms were covered in frost as well. Grimstone lept to me and created a flame in his hands and handed me the flame. 

Some spells can be handed to others to maintain, this fire spell is one of them. The small flame is  slowly helping, I feel my hands growing warmer. I turn to Grimstone and say, &quot;I-Is it dead?&quot;

&quot;No&quot;, he replies, &quot;the core is intact.&quot;

He walks over to the froze Crystal Dragon body, and reaches to the horn, it&#39;s mostly covered in ice. It seems like you could take it off if you saw it or wit-

*CRACK*

&quot;Item Retrieved, shall we go, Clay?&quot; Grimstone pockets the newly acquired Serpent Diamond shaped as a Crystal Dragon horn.

How much strength does it even require to remove it is beyond me.

But reta

&quot;Yeah, time to head back to Lord Whatshisface.&quot;

### On the Way Back...

Me and Grimstone finally reached Tomb again. The cool night air makes the city street feel even more silent. Crowgarden’s streets are really is dead(at night, that is).

I sense something.

&quot;Clay, stop&quot;, Grimstone puts a hand out in front of me, &quot;We are being followed.&quot;

Grimstone seems to agree, the air feels stale...dry...dead.

&quot;My my, if it isn&#39;t Grimmy~.&quot;

Who in the world is this? Only I get to give my master stupid names, and even *I* don&#39;t give names this bad.

&quot;... CLAY RUN!&quot;

[[I run]]

[[I pretend to Run]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="I run" tags="" position="3304,802" size="100,100">Clay runs back to the Hotel, anxious about what it is.

I break out into a sprint, and hear the two combatants’ voices being lost in the wind rushing past my face. I run through an alleyway, but it leads nowhere. 

However, the walls don&#39;t.

&quot;Spirits of those that crawl upon the ground when the sun goes out, the spiders, the roaches, the flies, the ants...I call on your strength, &lt;Night Crawler&gt;!&quot;

I start climbing up the wall, Night Crawler only works when the sun is out, thankfully it seems like midnight. 

I make it up to the building, and start running back. I&#39;m already exhausted, but I have to aid Grimstone. My legs feel heavier with every jump. I can see them down on the street ahead.

The woman seems to be walking to Grimstone, but he stands still. He seems to be trying to stall for time.
I brace myself. I’ve never turned a spell against a person before. Realistically, my attack couldn’t kill something that could make Grimstone tell me to run, but it can certainly create an opening. 
About 5 seconds before she reaches Grimstone, there is only one incantation I have that works in this situation, at least against enemies with sight. This spell always causes me to pass out. But I only have one chance.

“*Raging Storms...
...Billowing Clouds...”*
It almost feels like the blood in my body is being drawn out of me as I chant.

“...*&lt;Tempest Strike&gt;*.”

My vision goes white.

### Recovery

Well. How should I put this?

My heroism seems to not have been appreciated.

So firstly, I must establish: I am not allowed to pass out from casting a spell.

Grimstone says that is an extremely poor quality of a mage, to toss away our consciousness for the sake of a large gamble. 

Secondly: Casting this spell in particular at such a high output will leave me impaired for a day, which is fine.

Except for the fact that tomorrow is when we are supposed to be selling during the Rite.

It&#39;s morning right now, and Grimstone is out running errands. My arms are covered in bandages soaked in herbal oils. Certain herbs help with recovering mana, so maybe I’ll be up by- OH DAMN IT ALL.

I MADE A FOOL OF MYSELF OUT THERE.

So what happened, and it frustrates me to say, is I missed. I hit Grimstone instead of her. Granted, it did scare her off, and Grimstone was unharmed, BUT STILL.
If that was a truly dangerous situation, it means I’d have made a grave mistake.  And to add insult to injury, I was standing too close to the edge of that house I was standing on. So when I passed out, I fell and began rolling down the roof like a bag of potatoes. Grimstone had to catch me, and then take me back to the inn.

*knock knock*

“Good Morning, is Clay awake. This is Nadia, may I come in?”

Who?

“Who?”

“Nadia, sir. Lord Necron’s servant.”

Oh, I see, Grimstone must have called in a favor.
Damn it.

“Sure, I guess.”
I try to pull the covers over my arms, but they are too numb to do anything useful. She comes in, wearing her usual mercenary-type clothing, with a brown cloak that hooks over her right shoulder, and hangs over her left arm. The cloak bears the Necron Family Crest, the image of the weapon Necron itself.

I awkwardly wave my arm at her.

“I see, it seems as bad as he said.”

HUH? AS WHO SAID? WHAT’D THAT USELESS ALCHEMIST SAY? LEMME AT HIM. 

I try to hide my displeasure, ”I suppose so...”
”Well, I suppose I will carry out my mission”, she says, grabbing a stool from the end of the room and dragging it to the corner of my bed.
”Mission?”
”Put simply, babysitting. Or perhaps, Clay-sitting,” she tilts her head, thinking of a good way to describe this.

**There is no good way to describe this**

---

Some time went by.
Occasionally, Nadia looks around the room. She seemed intrigued by the collection of gemstones on the table beside me. I try to break the silence, “So, uh, how did Lord Whosits feel about the gem?”

“Lord Necron...”, she stresses the man’s actual name,” seemed most pleased. Upon being informed however that you were injured on the way back, he immediately sent for me to come here.”

I see, he must have felt bad.
Damn it.

“Isn’t that nice of him-”
”Yes, Lord Necron is very generous.”
She hardly let me finish my sentence before praising her boss. What a suck-up.

“How are your arms?”, Nadia asks, breaking the silence that crept back.

I move them around a bit, demonstrating they are mostly functional, “They are still useable, but they need to recover fully for me to safely use magic.”
”Magic...so you are both truly mages?”
”Well sort of. I’m more of an apprentice. Grimstone can be considered a ‘true’ mage.”

“Even if you are an apprentice, being able to cast spells at your level should classify you as a mage.”
”I guess,” she seems to make some sense, but...”I’m still not like Grimstone.”

“Poor comparison.”
”Poor comparison??”
”Yes. You are as bright as you are foolish, Clay.”
Take a guy out for dinner first before you insult him, will ya?

“Wouldn’t those cancel out?”
”Not exactly. Yes, you are very quick to learn.  But you are still unwise. You lack proper discernment.”
”Alright alright, enough. I get enough of that from the Old Man.”
”Understood.”

She goes silent.

It feels like an eternity goes by.
”Hey, can I go outside?”
”No.”
”Okay but what if I go anyways?”
”I am permitted to use force”, she now seems less maid-like and more bodyguard-like. Crazy how one can flip personas so quickly.

I realize the bandages have mostly run dry, Nadia however already did and had been preparing a new set. It takes her a few minutes, but she replaces them, though they feel tighter.

“I, uh, can’t feel my arms. Ya mind loosening them?”

“It is because you can’t feel them that we have these on you.”

She does have a point. I technically didn’t feel that, I only guessed. My arms still feel like slabs of meat.

This woman’s way of never losing arguments irritates me. I feel even if she were wrong she’d convince me she’s right. 

“What exactly made you want to serve Lord Nero?”
”Lord Necron...”

Ah, so close.

“has many servants. However, my family’s goal has been to serve the Necrons since their establishment. The first of our family, Maximus, was given the surname ‘Ul-Necron’ as a token of appreciation. Ever since then, the Ul-Necrons have served the Necron family proudly.”

“So it&#39;s a family tradition?”
”No. It is our family purpose.”

A purpose? Before you are born? That’s baffling.

“So I guess your full name is Nadia Ul-Necron?”

”That is correct. Do you have a family name? If one such as Grimstone were to take someone under his tutelage, they must surely be of high birth.”

&quot;I&#39;m more or less his adopted son, disgusting as that sounds to say.&quot;

&quot;Adopted? Well...&quot;, Nadia looks away a little embarassed at having asked.

The conversation more or less died, and eventually I fall asleep.
---


I wake up, it seems Nadia is still here. I guess I nodded off while we were talking.

“Are you feeling any better”, Nadia says, looking up from a book she&#39;s reading.

“I suppose? I can feel up to my elbows now”, I wave my numb hands at her.

She continues, “Very well, I will be going out for a moment to update Lord Necron. Do not leave the room.”

“I will not leave the room, understood.”

She looks at me once more, before walking out the door.

I&#39;m definitely aving the room.

---

“Just some fresh air, nothing more”, I mutter to myself as I walk outside the inn. It&#39;s been a few minutes since Nadia left. My eyes take a moment to adjust to the brighter scene before me. It looks like mid-afternoon. The street is busy. I see people passing by, a merchant selling expensive-seeming fabric, and children running through the streets playing games. The scene reminds me I haven’t explored Tomb at all yet.

Where should I go? I can see the Death Goddess’s palace at the center of the city.

[[Towards the Death Goddess’s Palace?]]

---

The city does in fact get much busier as I walk towards the center. I can’t count how many times I accidentally bumped into people on my way to the center because its so crowded. 

”Charm necklaces! Blessed directly by her majesty! We’re offering them for just one gold piece each!”

“Get yerself and yer family sum freshly killed mutton! Celebrate a New Year properly with a feast!”

New Year? What calendar are they on? I guess they consider the Rite of Prophecy to be the mark of a new year. Grimstone and I consider the longest day of the year the beginning of a new year, just like in Alexandria. But here it seems they mark it on this rite. I wonder if the other kingdoms declare a new year in different ways?

The Crowd starts to feel suffocating, but I keep moving. I eventually reach the walls of Empress’s Tomb.

After this point, I&#39;ve heard only guards and royal servants have been let through without invitation from the Death Goddess herself. I turn around and see the people swarm around the walls, merchants attempting to grab s

After some more talking, Nadia will swoop in and take Clay back to the hotel, again lecturing him.

&quot;So Clay, have you made the preparations?&quot;

&quot;Our bags are packed, we just need to see if any carriage drivers are going in the direction of Crowfallen. We can probably hitch a ride with a caravan if we hire ourselves out as mercenaries, I checked for a few listings in the vilage.&quot;

&quot;Good. Now, let&#39;s see...&quot;

Grimstone gets up out of his rocking chair and goes to the floorboard under the carpet, pulling out a satchel.

&quot;You&#39;re going for the reserve stocks?&quot;

&quot;I kept these old things in case we needed to sell them. Seems like the optimal time for it.&quot;

&quot;Of course, though, will people want any of it?&quot;

&quot;Of course they will, take a look at this...&quot;

He pulls out a green gem from within. 

“This gem isn&#39;t meant to be worn, rather it&#39;s to be used. This one right here lets you light a fire easily.&quot;

&quot;Can&#39;t you do that for free with two rocks from the ground?&quot;

He mutters something and pulls out another gem, this time yellow.

&quot;This gem is extremely hard, perfect for a chisel.&quot;

&quot;Well can you make it into a chisel itself?&quot;

&quot;Of course you can make it into a-&quot;

The Old Man thinks it over some more.

&quot;Not without any major difficulty.&quot;

I look at his bag, then at him, trying to convince myself people would actually buy any of this.

&quot;I assure you, this trip will be fruitful in more ways than one.&quot;

Grimstone says this with a strangely optimistic tone.

We continue to discuss the details of the trip, and before we know it, it&#39;s almost nighttime. We had already made preparations for the road a day ago, so it was simply a matter of making sure nobody breaks in while we&#39;re away. We stand outside the Shack as Grim turns to me and asks, &quot;Clay, do you know the incantation?&quot;

&quot;Well yeah, you taught me it earlier.&quot;

I reach for my staff and imagine the runes carved in it as an extension of my arm&#39;s veins. The runes begin to glow a faint blue.

*&quot;Illusions and reality are of the same substance. That which is real is mere illusions...That which is an illusion is of reality...Become like nothing. Vanish. Be destroyed. Be vacant. Be hollow. Be enveloped in the &lt;Shroud of Illusion!&gt;.&quot;*

The form of the Old Man&#39;s Shack begins to twist and blur into the surroundings, before completely vanishing.

I look at where the shack is hidden before returning my gaze to the old man. I held myself proudly, ready to be praised for a job well do-

&quot;You took too long.&quot;

&quot;Hey! Have you ever seen ME complain when you take half a year to choose what to buy in the market?&quot;

Thus, we set out on our merry way.

### The Serpent Valley

After about 3 days, we&#39;ve made our way to the Tombstone Mountains, and are now trekking towards the Serpent Valley. Another day of walking until we arrive.

Luckily, a few merchants agreed to hire us in exchange for free transport to the city. All the other adventurers were hired out already, so they&#39;re stuck with just us.

&quot;Behind you! &lt;i&gt;&lt;Earth Spire&gt;&lt;/i&gt;!&quot;

I whirl around and take a step back as a pointed mass of earth shot its way up from the ground, shattering the Skeleton that managed to reach my blind spot.

&quot;I could have handled that, Old Ma-AH!&quot;

I duck and roll, barely dodging the club that one particularly large Skeleton is holding.

Did I say ease? I take it back now.

&quot;What is that thing made of? Nothing human skeleton can be that big!&quot;

Its bones had a strange texture. I realized why as I took a closer look. The &quot;bones&quot; making up its body were themselves made of smaller bones.  It looked like a Skeleton made of Skeletons. It leaves me no room to note its structure as it takes another swing at me. 

Instantly, I grip my staff with both arms and hold it above me.

*CRACK!*

The wooden club begins to splinter on impact, rendering my arms numb as my field of vision starts to go dark. 

&quot;&lt;i&gt;&lt;Shockwave!&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&quot;
**BOOM***

The world around me spins as I&#39;m sent backward, my body is tossed against the ground as I roll for what felt like an eternity. My ears are ringing. I finally land face down, weakly looking up and at the Skeleton. I put around 20 meters between us. It, however, just recovered, and does not seem happy. Is this it? Do I die like this? I haven&#39;t even become rich yet. What happens to all my magical skills when I die?

Well. I will see the Death Goddess, either way, I guess.

I feel a tremor, a sudden white pulse fills my field of view.

I squint my eyes and see the giant Skeleton....No, pieces of it, flying in all directions. In the place of the monster was my master: I barely managed to catch the last second of his signature skill.

It&#39;s a simple skill, really. Just a physical enhancement. What makes it his signature? The fact that it&#39;s his go-to for stronger enemies. Usually, fire or ice works on weaker enemies, but in cases like these, he uses it to quickly end the battle. As far as I can tell, you don&#39;t want to be on the receiving end of it.

My body feels heavy, and I stumble back a bit as I rise. The ground feels like it&#39;s rolling beneath my feet. The sun feels too bright.

&quot;Well, what have you learned?&quot;, he asks.

&quot;Other than the taste of dirt? Not much.&quot;

&quot;Good. Know the taste of dirt, become accustomed to it. Anyone who wishes to become anything in life must know and love the taste of dirt because only after tasting it can one rise up stronger.&quot;

&quot;Old man, I know you say my cooking is bad, but now&#39;s not the time.&quot;, I respond, rolling my eyes.

&quot;As I always say, Clay, there is always a bit of &#39;you&#39; in every dish you make.&quot;

&quot;Yes yes well until you hire a maid, enjoy the taste of dirt.&quot;

After tending to our (my) wounds, we pick up our belongings and march onwards. The weather so far has been calm, sunny, not a cloud in sight. It feels comical considering we are going to the Death Goddess&#39;s domain, Crowgarden. Her kingdom is often associated with despair, as death typically is. Albeit, people are coming to her in a few days with major hopes for the future, perhaps the weather understands that. Though I wonder, why does the Death Goddess have the ability to see the future? I feel like I remember hearing it in a story once.

&quot;Yo Grim, what was the story you once told me about how the Death Goddess gained her future-sight?&quot;

He turns to me, &quot;&#39;Yo&#39;? &#39;Grim&#39;? I thought you lost that verbal tick of yours years ago.&quot;
&quot;Shut up, Old Man.&quot;

He shakes his head, chuckling, &quot;As for that story...hmm....&quot;, he looks off to the side, pausing for a moment, &quot;Ah yes, I remember. I believe legends say she actually stole that power from Seraphus in battle. Seraphus posed such a large threat since she not only could cause mass destruction but knew the Gods&#39; attacks before they even landed. Morrigan, however, used that against her, as she noticed Seraphus only ever looked so far into the future. She decided to plant a series of obvious attacks using her legendary weapon, Necron, so Seraphus would try dodging it. However, she had another attack planned immediately after that Seraphus had no time to prepare for. Using her ability to drain the life of her enemies, she made her move and ended up also stealing Seraphus&#39;s future sight. Seraphus only managed to escape however due to her sheer power. No amount of future sight can guard you against a being of power and absolute destruction.&quot; 

I see. This is in line with what I&#39;ve learned so far. Much of one&#39;s power depends on their Soul. Souls are like hands, in the sense they affect and interact with the world that hands can&#39;t touch. A hand can&#39;t interact with ideas, feel joy, or think for itself, but a soul does. The Gods must have the most powerful souls. 

And before we knew it. We arrived at Tomb, the center of the Death Goddess&#39;s Kingdom.

### Tomb
We finally arrive. The merchants were hurling promises of upcoming discounts, limited time spices, and rare jewlery. There were people stringing banners between lamp posts, each displaying a year and a depiction of the Goddess&#39;s prophecy: presumably having come true.
People were placing images of their loved ones at their windowsills, adorned with flowers and candles. The walkways were covered in hurried drawings of the Death Goddess made by children. Many of them depict her leading them, protecting them, and even playing with them.

&quot;WATCH OUT!&quot;

Startled, I leap backwards. A horse pulling a wagon races past me, two kids straddled on its back. The Tomb Knights, wearing brown and black cloaks, gave chase. For a city called the Tomb, it was quite lively.

After securing a room at an inn, I toss my bag against the wall and flop onto the bed, it&#39;s around sundown.

&quot;FINALLY. You never appreciate real beds till after a trip.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t get too comfortable Clay, else you won&#39;t wake up tomorrow&quot;, the Old Man says, opening the curtains, orange light fills the room from the orange sunset.

&quot;Ugh....&quot;, I roll in bed, as if having just woken up.

&quot;It&#39;s an important day tomorrow, if we don&#39;t act fast other merchants will take the best spots&quot;, the old man sorts out the items in his bag, taking out a wooden sign that reads &quot;GRIMSTONE&#39;S STONES.&quot;

&quot;That sign is still horrible, we need a new name.&quot;

&quot;Non-negotiable.&quot;

&quot;I know it&#39;s non-negotiable, you&#39;ve said it countless times, and I&#39;ll keep saying it, we need a new name.&quot;

He shakes his head and leaves the sign leaning against the nightstand. Snapping, he makes a small flame and lights the candle on the stand. He pulls out his diary and starts writing, as he usually does every night.

I grab a book from my satchel, it&#39;s a book of assorted legends from all over the land. I flip around till I find some from Crowfallen, and start reading.

After a few hours, Grimstone blows out the candle and tucks himself in. I place my book on the nightstand and stare out the window at the night sky. The legend of the Moon God came to mind as a I saw the crescent moon. They say that the Moon&#39;s shape is always chosen by the Moon God at night.

&quot;Clay?&quot;

&quot;What?&#39;

&quot;Go to sleep.&quot;

&quot;How&#39;d you know I was awake?&quot;

&quot;Your breathing.&quot;

&quot;I guess I&#39;ll stop breathing then.&quot;

&quot;Good luck&quot;, Grimstone mutters, turning over in his bed.

Staring out into the darkroom, my eyes grow tired. Slumber overcomes me.

### Preparations

Two days till the event.

&quot;Yo.&quot;

&quot;......&quot;

&quot;Yo Old Man.&quot;

&quot;......&quot;

&quot;Wake up.&quot;

&quot;......&quot;

&quot;Someone wants to buy-&quot;

&quot;I HAVE AWAKENED!&quot;

I tumble backward, just barely dodging the Old Man&#39;s forehead as it suddenly shot up.

&quot;Dammit....ugh...greedy as ever.&quot;

&quot;Is it okay to come in?&quot;, our buyer says, &quot;I don&#39;t want to impose if he&#39;s asleep.&quot;

&quot;No no, he&#39;s livelier than ever.&quot;

A man wearing a black and brown cloak over his shoulders, similar to that of the Tomb Knights, walks in. Grimstone tilted his head smiling, &quot;Ah, well if it isn&#39;t Lord Necron?&quot;
The man scratched the side of his face, &quot;Please, call me Darius, Grimstone.&quot;

&quot;Well then, Darius, what brings you here?&quot;
&quot;I just so happened to catch word of a certain Alchemist having entered the capital, right when we needed him most.&quot;
&quot;Oh? What will it be this time? Has the Necron Family been unable to find another crucial gem for The Offering?&quot;

&quot;Please don&#39;t tease us....but yes, we have been unable to secure a proper Serpent Diamond. It should be worth 2,000 Gold Skulls.&quot;

&quot;2,000 Gold Skulls? That&#39;s a hefty ask. Are you able to pay?&quot;

My eyes and ears perk up at hearing the amount &quot;2,000&quot; and the word &quot;Gold&quot; in the same sentence.

&quot;But of course. We&#39;ve been able to pay every time before, haven&#39;t we?&quot;

&quot;That is true. But isn&#39;t this over a hundred times the normal amount? What makes this year so special?&quot;

&quot;This year is the 2,000th anniversary of the Crusades, and for this year&#39;s Crusade, they&#39;re announcing her Crusader during the Prophecy. This Rite is much more important than the last ones.&quot;

&quot;The Death Goddess&#39;s Crusader you say...have you met him?&quot;

&quot;No, apparently she&#39;s keeping it a secret until the announcement. Rumors are saying, however, it&#39;s a blacksmith.&quot;

&quot;A blacksmith as a Crusader?&quot;

&quot;Indeed. Our Goddess&#39;s ways are often beyond our comprehension.&quot;

I could have sworn Grimstone muttered something offensive under his breath before saying, &quot;Back to the topic at hand, do you know where we could source the gem from?&quot;

&quot;The Old Mines right at the end of the Serpent Valley.&quot;

Ah, so we are exploring a mineshaft now. Fantastic. Totally in-line with our plans to sell gems.

Grimstone shakes his head, &quot;Making a poor old man in his old age go down into dangerous mines. Really Darius, have you no shame?&quot;

Lord Necron smirks, &quot;Surely if you considered yourself a poor old man, you wouldn&#39;t have secured transport by offering yourself as swords for hire, correct?&quot;

&quot;Ha! Observant as ever, aren&#39;t you?!&quot;, Grimstone&#39;s chuckling fills the room.

&quot;I have my ways...Well, do you accept?&quot;

&quot;Guess I have no choice, Clay?&quot;

Leaned against a wall, I raise my hand a bit, &quot;Ready when you are.&quot;

&quot;Brilliant,&quot; Lord Necron says, &quot;I will have the payment immediately available once the gem is retrieved.&quot;

A realization strikes me square in the face, &quot;I guess I should go stock up on supplies, huh? I can&#39;t help but think how much we are going to spend on supplies and might not even find the accrused rock.&quot;

&quot;No need,&quot; Lord Necron cuts in,&quot;I had already made arrangements. Nadia-!&quot;

&quot;At your command, Lord Necron,&quot; a woman dressed in a black hood enters. She has the appearance of a mercenary, but the demeanor of a servant. She heaves a large bag onto my bed, and opens it ot reveal an assortment of potions, matches, and dried foodstuffs. &quot;This should suffice, no?&quot;, the servant says while looking up at Lord Necron.

&quot;Yes, that will do,&quot; he says. 

And with that, our mission begins.

### Into The Mines

I look down into the cave, and it feels like it looks back at me. The dead torch at its mouth and the worn pickaxes near it make the scene feel dead.

&quot;And away we go!&quot;
The old man says, suddenly flying past me. At least he&#39;s lively.

I channel energy into my legs and leap into the mines. My vision is encased in darkness, but luckily I have a general sense of what&#39;s around me. I wouldn&#39;t be the disciple of a blind warrior if I relied on sight all the- 
&quot;CLAY!&quot;
My body goes numb. The pain is terrible. I think I broke multiple bones. I lost my bearing. It hurts. 

I lie prone on the cave floor, I sense something in front of me.

The letter says that he is to go to Alexandria and present this to the guards at the entrance, further instructions will be given once it is processed.
Grimstone concludes by telling Clay this is his final test as his pupil. 
Grimstone also tells him this is his chance to go and do magical research in Alexandria, as the libraries there are chock full of knowlege.
Clay relents, and Grimstone gives Clay a map of how to get to Alexandria. Grim also tells Clay he will be going out to do &quot;research&quot;

My eyes feel like they have started to adjust to the darkness, and I make out the vague shape of a man with misshapen hair. 
&quot;Clay, I told you not to fly blind&quot;, I can hear him shaking his head from his voice. I feel him grab my arm and drag me up.

He casts healing spells on me, and all I can do is mutter, trying to think of something to say. I still haven&#39;t mastered fighting without sight as he can. I&#39;m not even a novice. Moving without sight is not even feasible for me. How am I supposed to advance? I&#39;m a capable fighter, but unless I can do what seems impossible, what&#39;s left?

&quot;Clay...&quot;, his voice bears down on me. 

Oh boy....I&#39;m in for it, aren&#39;t I....?
&quot;Y-yes?&quot;
&quot;No more using the &lt;Blind Leap&gt;, got it? It&#39;s still beyond your skill range.&quot;
&quot;B-...fine.&quot;

I can&#39;t seem to defend myself. Grimstone&#39;s techniques are still leagues ahead of mine. 

&quot;Hm...What an interesting Cave.&quot;
&quot;What&#39;s so special about it?&quot;

&quot;The way it winds downwards and around, it seems to go on in circles and twisting, and it seems like it reaches the surface at another point here. The mine seems to really start at the lowest point.&quot;
&quot;Didn&#39;t Seraphus once fight Morrigan here? She could&#39;ve dug into the ground and formed the tunnels with her body while slithering through the rocks.&quot;

&quot;Perhaps...but if so....there seems to be an eerie lack of monsters here.&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s be thankful that there is an eerie lack of monsters.&quot;

After a few minutes, Grimstone pipes up, &quot;Well, I believe the lower levels of the mine should begin right here.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;re you talking about there&#39;s nothing there it&#39;s just more ro-&quot;

He takes his staff and props it against a boulder, pushing it aside effortlessly, revealing a stretch of tunnels that seem much more man-made. 

I&#39;m dumbfounded.

&quot;Clay, remember your breathing incantations. The air down here likely is not pure.&quot;

&quot;Yes yes...*Oh wind that breathes life to those who accept it, become as a veil to guard me against impurity. Let my words speak peace and my chest bear life. The wind holds with it the stories of our ancestors, the tales of heroism, of failure, of life, of death....&quot;*

The only sound that fills the cave are our footsteps, and the muttering of the near-endless incantation.

As we continue to walk through the cave, I notice the sparkling of some gems. These aren&#39;t useful gems, however. The most common crystal, Earth Mica, is flimsy yet has a distinct shine to it. It has no real use...speaking of useless...

&quot;Hey Grimstone?&quot;

&quot;Why do I feel like you&#39;re secretly mocking me?&quot;

Dammit, he saw right through me. Well he&#39;s blind so...heard through me? Sensed through me? Tasted through me? Smelled through me? I shrug, pointing at the stretch of tunnels before us, &quot;Mockery aside-&quot;

&quot;So you were-?&quot;,  he turns towards me suddenly.

I continue, &quot;-how much further do we need to go?&quot;

&quot;Tsk,&quot; he wacks his staff against the floor and waits a moment, &quot;about 30 steps this way&quot;, he takes a turn at a fork in the tunnel that I hadn&#39;t even noticed. I begin counting steps.

&quot;Here we are,&quot; he stretches his arms out, pointing towards something in the darkness up ahead.

&quot;-No reaction? Oh it must be dark then.&quot;

Right on the money. He creates a small flame at the end of his finger, then condenses it into a shining orb, increasing the intensity. Shielding my eyes from the light source itself, I begin to see red gems all across the ground and cave walls.

MONEY.

ALL I SEE IS MONEY.

WE WILL FINALLY BE OUT OF DEBT.

AND THIS IS ENOUGH TO LIVE IN LUXURY.

*rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh*

&quot;Grim was that you?&quot;

&quot;No...?&quot;

I feel a knot form in my chest, as I look towards the large cave chamber.

The area seems large and mostly vacant in the middle. There is a large mass of shifting stones there but nothing else.

Wait.

Shifting stones?

&quot;Grimstone is that aURHG-&quot;, something yanks me off to the side.

Where I was standing, a spike made of red crystal took its place, Grimstone pulled me away by my collar.

&quot;...Crystal dragon, and a strong one too, it seems.&quot;

The shifting mass of stones in the middle of the room begins to form into a ferocious lizard-like creature, with a face resembling a rhinoceros, but broader and more like a shield. The back is covered in spiked crystals, along with a swinging tail whose end is a dense mass of rock with spikes of the same kind. The front of this creature seems to be adorned in crystalline armor.

Grimstone thinks it over, &quot;If there&#39;s a Crystal Dragon here, that means that the crystals here are all the unusable...except...&quot;

I gesture towards him to continue, I don&#39;t want to cut off my breathing incantation.

&quot;The dragon&#39;s horn, on its nose. The only crystal that won&#39;t cause any real harm to anything...aside from us if it hits us.&quot;

We should...

Clay outright declines, and the servant is pissed.

Clay hands the letter to the servant {who relays the information to her superiors, and they relay it to Sofiya, who will eventually permit Clay to enter the Royal Palace of Alexandria}

Clay will sit down next to her and try to interrogate her, but he can&#39;t get much information out from her nodding and shaking her head.

Clay will remove the mask covering her eyes, and then he&#39;ll realize she&#39;s crying. 

Clay will feel *very* guilty

Morrigan, the Goddess of Death, however, saw that giving the human life an end would give them rest from the troubles that life had offered them while also making it so that the human life becomes more meaningful. Thus she gave them Death.

Then, Sofiya, the Goddess of Wisdom, attempted to share her wisdom with mankind. She wished to give them the knowledge to learn, teach, and grow throughout their lives. Thus she gave them Wisdom.

Polemos, the God of War, taught the humans War, as Polemos felt lives without conflict were simply too monotonous to be considered worth living. Thus he gave them War.

Solus, God of the Day, and Luna, Goddess of the Night, looked towards the heavens. They decided to grant the human life structure, and their eternal dance is what creates the pattern of Day and Night that governs mankind. Thus, they gave them the Day, and the Night.

However, while the other Gods wished for the humans to grow, learn, and thrive, Seraphus did not share their benevolence. Humanity disgusted her, with their flaws and arrogance causing her to resent them simply for existing. She saw the Gods creating something which she believed ought to be destroyed. She believed that since the humans would inevitably wipe themselves out through their greed and malice, it was better for her to wipe them out. Thus, the Chaos-Serpent God began her rampage over the world, bringing mayhem and monstrosities in her wake, causing death and destruction on a magnitude never seen before. She caused earthquakes, demolished humanity&#39;s greatest structures, created all manner of evil creatures from the human corpses, and feasted upon all the ravaged and tormented souls. Her final plan was to encircle the earth that she may swallow it up for good, bringing an end to this futile game the Gods seemed foolishly intent on playing.

However, the 6 other Gods took a stand against the Great Serpent and sealed her with the 7 seals, and to this day Seraphus lies there, awaiting her release once more...

[[Chapter III - The Tournament of Crusaders]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="39" name="Chapter III - The Tournament of Crusaders" tags="" position="3803,3091" size="100,100">Clay enters the Palace and is shown to his room with Ars, another candidate, who is actually from the Death Goddess Kingdom. Ars remains distant from Clay, not trying to let himself divulge what he knows about the upcoming trials. 

THE FIRST TRIAL
The first trial is the Sphinx&#39;s riddles. Clay is in a team of 10 people among 3 teams. It plays out as follows:

Riddle 1: &quot;I have two arms, when one rises the other falls. When all is orderly, the arms are still. If a man holds my hand, he is deceiving you. What am I?”
The team suggests
 - A Lever
 - A Woman
 + A Scale(From Clay)
 
This answer is obvious. The real choice is whether or not Clay will rush in and answer first. If he doesn&#39;t, then the second team will answer. 

Riddle 2: &quot;What is above speech, besides listening, and before intellect.&quot;
Ars immediately shouts that the answer is an Eye. He knows this because he was given this prophecy by the Death Goddess that one day someone will ask him this question, and that this is the answer. Everyone shouts at him and one person nearly attacks him for it, but the Sphinx responds that he is correct. 

Riddle 3: “7 Snakes have bitten me with 4 fangs, I am now paralyzed. What am I?”
This riddle is impossibly difficult for the teams, as they know it is a symbolic question. No team can arrive at the answer. Sofiya orders The Sphinx give the answer. With a large laugh, he utters that it is Seraphus. Sofiya states that it is false, there are only 6 Gods and 7 Seals used, 7 and 4 is an absurd pair. The Sphinx arises and declares &quot;I am Ao, I speak only the truth.&quot; Sofiya is enraged and places a Greater Seal on Ao, and declares henceforth that the Sphinx has succumb to insanity. She continues that the Trials will continue as usual. 

Clay will spot Alethia sneaking around here


THE SECOND TRIAL

The second trial is magic circle reconstruction. Clay is a master at this, as he&#39;s needed to do this countless times after each time Grimstone botches an experimental magic circle in an experiment. Magic Circles however are a form of magic that is considered extremely complex and slow, meaning very few choose to learn how to form or fix them. 

Clay repairs his magic cirlce instantly. Next to him he sees Ars struggling with his. He could choose to sneak the answer to Ars. If he decides to, Ars will be his opponent in the Combat Trial. If not, he will face someone far stronger in the final trial.

Alethia will target Clay while he trains and nearly kidnap him here[Insert kidnapping sequence]

THE THIRD TRIAL

The final trial is the trial of combat.
- If you helped Ars
    
    - Ars has 3 ways to be beaten and 1 way to lose against him
    
- If you didn’t help Ars
    You face off against Nakht, a stronger opponent with 1 way to win and 4 ways to lose.
	
The day after the final trial is a relatively relaxed time. Most of the candidates are heading back home. Some are going out for celebrations. The options available depend on whether or not you spoke to certain people over the course of the Tournament

[[The Divine Pact]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="40" name="Go to the Palace kitchen" tags="" position="96,3087" size="100,100">The Palace Kitchen is a place famous for its food and infamous for gossip. 
Here Clay will ask for something to eat, probably something simple he used to eat as a kid. He will also hear some rumors while talking with a chef

The past Crusader candidates have all been attacked by some mysterious figure, leaving them too afraid to actually fight in the Crusade. Sofiya&#39;s Pages have been working 24/7 to prevent this but they&#39;ve gotten nowhere. All they&#39;ve found out is the attacker wears red. 

Sofiya is currently the only Goddess without an officially declared Crusader, and that if Clay is lost then Alexandria will have to withdraw as per the rules of the Crusade, since the deadline is so close.

After hearing these rumors, Clay will finish his meal and head back to his room

[[Next Day]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="41" name="Go to the Lesser Library" tags="" position="308,3061" size="100,100">The servant gives information about the lesser library to Clay.
Clay has options to choose from for books to read.(Book appears in Side Stories Menu)
Clay finds a person to talk to, a researcher(remembering that he needs to do his own research) 
He has a chance to discuss researchwith this person, what it&#39;s like, etc.
Clay will spend some time reading the books on Alexandria&#39;s history.
After some time, he will go to his room
[[Return to my Room]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="42" name="Roam the Gardens outside" tags="" position="706,3016" size="100,100">Going into the Garden, Clay walks. He barely just catches Sofiya herself walking through the Garden.
He sees a hooded figure in a red cloak on the Palace walls, watching Sofiya. It then looks at him, then vanishes. 
[[Follow]]
[[It&#39;s just another page]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="43" name="Follow" tags="" position="904,3416" size="100,100">Clay leaps over the wall and follows, and sees the person sprint run into the city, Clay follows. He runs through the Bazaar, before finally cornering them in an Alleyway... or perhaps...being cornered himself.
Clay tries communication, but the person simply rushes at him. 

He puts up a wall of earth between him and the figure, but she breaks through it. 
He realizes that she used no magic.
He realizes he must escape. 
Clay tries fighting back using Shock Pulse, but the figure simply ignores them. 
Clay tries Earth Spire, but the figure stands atop the end of it unphased, then rushes down at Clay. 
Clay is near-instantly overwhelmed. He is tied up. The figure essentially incapacitates him.
All Clay can do is watch and hear. He recognizes the figure is at least a girl(hurts his pride a little).
Clay watches the figure look around panicked. Suddenly, 10 high ranking pages appear around the red cloaked kidnapper. A fight ensues, she escapes. Clay is freed, and they return. Clay is warned about the presence of a Candidate-napper: someone who has been kidnapping the candidates. The pages can&#39;t make heads or tails of why they are kidnapping them. 
Clay is sent back to his room.
[[Return to my Room]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="44" name="It&#39;s just another page" tags="" position="584,3149" size="100,100">Clay disregards it, and continues walking. He sees Sofiya and her servants walk through the Garden, although they are veiling her from the sun. They walk past Clay, Sofiya says something to one of her servants, and the servant relays the message. It&#39;s more or less her hoping he has gotten used to being there.
If Clay continues to walk through the Garden, he can choose to speak to the Gardener.
[[Speak to the Gardener]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="45" name="Speak to the Gardener" tags="" position="634,3293" size="100,100">Clay can ask the Gardener about

Afer a while, Clay retursn to his room

The training regime this time is to force him to increase his regeneration speed of magical energy, as he stands the best chance of surviving that way. The traditional way of doing so is to have him expend his magical energy for as long as possible continuously. The way they plan to do that is to place some amulets on him. These amulets continously siphen his magical energy supply. For a few days, he will be utterly and totally exhausted in terms of mana. Since he can&#39;t cast spells to any real capacity during this time, he will be doing physical training. Clay is already fit, so they are polishing his existing skills. 
Clay will be learning to dodge properly over the next few days. 
Clay will not be having fun. 
After today&#39;s work, he will be presented with the same three options.
[[Go to the Palace kitchen DAY II]]
[[Go to the Lesser Library DAY II]]

(Clay can sense security is at its absolute maximum. He constantly feels followed).
Some of the pages are presumably on break. Clay doesn&#39;t feel like interrupting their fun. 
The gardener is still here, he seems distressed. He also notices the pages.

If you choose to ask about what he knows about the pages, he will respond with the fact his wife is actually a page, and so is his daughter. He tells Clay to keep it a secret.

If asked more about them, he&#39;ll be given a rundown of their lives, save for their names.

[[Return to my room Day II]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="51" name="Return to my room Day II" tags="" position="304,4455" size="100,100">Same deal as last time, except Clay is notably more sore than usual\
[[Next Day(II) BREAK DAY!]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="52" name="PLOT POINT: ROYAL SELECTION" tags="Notes" position="896,4219" size="100,100">The Royal Selection

The IR&#39;s governance is part republic, part monarchy. 
The King and Queens are elected. The previous King(King Perceus Rex VI) of the IR passed away, leaving behind his royal family. Given the election-based succession system of the Kingdom, all members of the Kingdom technically have a chance at ruling, but the rulers always end up being of the upper crust of society.

The most prominent candidates for the selection are
1) Prince Prometheus (First child of King Rex), a corrupt character who still holds most of the public&#39;s opinion in his favor
2) Lady Priscilla(Noble of House of Athena, named for the war hero that founded it), her opinion is very very strong among the merchants
3) Princess(a nominal title) Alethia Polemos I, a young girl who is the daughter of the War God, has the backing of War God Polemos, and was granted the title Princess by him. [THIS IS THIA]

Polemos is scheming to get Alethia into power because they want to abolish the royal succession through a loophole in the succession system. The entire congress of the republic is against her, and offered her a public challenge where they would support her if she herself goes as Polemos&#39;s Crusader.

This all went according to plan.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="53" name="Next Day(II) BREAK DAY!" tags="" position="412,4569" size="100,100">!!!!THERE ARE CHOICES IN THIS PASSAGE!!!!!!!!!!
Most are inconsequential and are thus summarized here in one node.

Timeskip to 4 days later, Clay is finally used to the amulets.
He hears a knock at his door. This time its not his Mentor, but rather a messenger. He has been a note from his Mentor. 

The note will read &quot;Today is a day off. He fought hard for this day off, so Clay better enjoy it. The one condition is he is not permitted to remove the Amulets, and he must also equip one more.&quot; The amulet is bundled together with the note. Clay reluctantly puts it on and his sense of comfort has disappeared.

Clay has also been given some payment for his time here as Crusader, courtesy of the Goddess: 100 Gold Coins. Clay remembers that Alexandrian Gold is worth less than Ionian Gold, possibly due to a stronger economy.

As he turns around, he sees the red cloaked figure in the window, only to be subsequently chased away by a few pages.

Clay will spend his morning wandering the streets of Alexandria, accompanied by a page escort. Eventually he will realize that the page in question is Anya once more. He asks why she is there, and she says one word: &quot;decoy.&quot;

Clay infers she&#39;s there to make it look like she&#39;s the only person guarding him. He recognizes that memorable feeling of being watched once more.

He is going to an old spot he visited with Grimstone once to check if a mark he left is still there. It is. After verifying this, he will return back to the palace. 

Looking back, he could have sworn he saw a flash of red by the tree. 

Its about noontime, Clay and Anya are hungry. Returning to the Palace seems smart

As they go back, they see people at the guild placing news at the board regarding the War God&#39;s Crusader. All Clay can say is that the girl looks rather intimidating, and Anya agrees.

Once it&#39;s about the afternoon, Anya and Clay part ways at the doors of the castle, and Clay enters. A servant has a message for him stating he is summoned before the Goddess.

The servants waste no time in dragging him off to be prepared. 

In about an hour, the meeting occurs. Another servant speaks on behalf of the Goddess(who is present behind a veil), asking about Clay&#39;s progress. She also offers him a chance to withdraw if he feels he is not able, they say they will call back Nakht to replace him.
Clay won&#39;t withdraw.

The servant reminds him the ceremony is in one week. He should brace himself for it. 

After eating his lunch, Clay is free.

It is now the afternoon, where will Clay go?

While training for a few hours, the figure will approach him.
For the first time, they will finally speak.
	1. At first Clay will try to signal for help by casting Shockwave, but Alethia puts out her hand saying &quot;Wait!&quot;
	2. She will then ask him why he answered the summons to be a Crusader, Clay said he was essentially forced to by his Mentor. Alethia will be shocked at this, and tells him that he&#39;s risking his life doing this. Clay responds saying &quot;well I suppose I am, yeah.&quot; Alethia will ask him how he can just gamble with his life so easily, Clay will ask her why she&#39;s gambling with her life by trying to kidnap these Crusaders. Alethia will respond that she&#39;s doing it under orders.
Clay: &quot;aren&#39;t you playing with your life just as much?&quot;
Alethia: &quot;Well, I am stronger than you. I can handle myself.&quot;
Clay: &quot;Well you seemed like you weren&#39;t &#39;handling yourself&#39; when you last tried to kidnap me.&quot;
Alethia: &quot;Oh please it&#39;s just because I didn&#39;t want to have to get serious.&quot;
Clay will mockingly imitate her.
Alethia: &quot;Seriously how old are you, are you unable to come up with a better comback than just-?&quot;
Clay: &quot;And are you unable to do anything other than follow me all day?&quot;
Alethia: &quot;FOLLOWING YOU? Okay hotshot, you get an ounce of attention from your kidnapper and suddenly you&#39;re a celebrity?&quot;
Clay:&quot;Mad?&quot;
Alethia will go for a punch, Clay will dodge effortlessly. Alethia will go for a few more hits, and she whiffs each one. 
Clay: &quot;Oh c&#39;mon missy, why not go &#39;serious&#39; like you were talking all high n&#39; mighty about just a second ago?&quot;
Alethia will step back and pull out her two blades and form them into a bow, drawing a magic arrow and say &quot;Draw your weapon, Crusader of Sofiya.&quot;
Clay will respond with, &quot;Too bad, don&#39;t need to&quot;, and reveal the hole he had been digging beneath her feet using magic. 
Clay will fire a Shock pulse at her hands as she falls and knock her weapon away. Clay will then seal the hole around her waste so she&#39;s stuck in the ground. 
Alethia will try to resist but fail.
Clay will sit right next to her cross-legged and say &quot;Well miss, you appear have not gone &#39;serious&#39; yet, can your &#39;seriousness&#39; get you out of this trap?&quot;
Alethia will use magic to shatter the ground around her and pull herself out, Clay will roll away, saying &quot;Oh you have magic too? No fair!&quot;
Alethia will grab her weapon, stand and point a shortsword at him saying &quot;Listen here, magician boy-&quot;
&quot;Magician boy?&quot;
&quot;I&#39;ll let you stay a Crusader. But know who you&#39;ve made a rival of-&quot;
&quot;Rival? I swear I didn&#39;t sign up for this.&quot;
&quot;I Alethia Polemos VI-&quot;
&quot;Who?&quot;
This will make Alethia stop.
&quot;You&#39;re mocking me again?&quot;
&quot;No seriously, who?&quot;
&quot;I SAW YOU READING THE SIGN EARLIER WITH MY FACE ON IT?&quot;
&quot;Oh so you were stalking me then too? Man you&#39;re good at that, I hadn&#39;t even sensed you then.&quot;
&quot;I should just end you here and now then huh.&quot;
Alethia will realize the pages are on their way, and she will bid farewell.
Clay will mutter, &quot;I didn&#39;t even get a chance to call you ugly.&quot;
Alethia, &quot;I HEARD THAT!&quot;

At this point, it is now sunset.

Clay will continue reading a book in the library

Later, things will be very calm. Clay will hear a voice and some footsteps. Peering over, Clay can see a young woman wearing all white, fairly basic clothes too. 
At first he can ignore her. But eventually she seems worried. Clay saunters over. Clay asks what&#39;s wrong, she says she can&#39;t find a book she left here. Clay asks if it&#39;s important. The woman says it is. Clay agrees to help find it, and asks for the name of the book.
The book&#39;s name is:
&quot;Queen&#39;s Assassin - The Killer and the Soldier - Third Kingdom Arc: Volume 5&quot;
Clay is dumbfounded by the name of the book. Clay asks again if it is absolutely important, the woman says it is with every fiber of her being. Clay is swept away by her determination, and agrees to help. For a few hours, he helps her find the book. It ends up being mixed up in the stack of books Clay was going to read, he picked it up by mistake. 
At the end, Clay asks what her name is, and she simply smiles and walks away.
Clay goes to read his book, and a maid comes in to alert him that it is time for dinner. Clay is crestfallen and goes to his room. 
[[Rite of the Divine Pact]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="54" name="Neo I" tags="Side-Story" position="803,95" size="100,100">&lt;size=150%&gt; &quot;You&#39;re a Good Kid&quot;&lt;size=100%&gt;
Neo was recovering from his battle against Clay.
&quot;DAMMIT. WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT POWER- ERGH-&quot;, he coughed up blood and drew a deep breath, before slumping against a tree.
&quot;IT CAN&#39;T BE IT CAN&#39;T BE IT CAN&#39;T BE! ONLY WE HAVE THAT POWER. NOBODY CAN USE THE POWER OF THE FORSAKEN SERPENT EXCEPT I.&quot; His wounds began to flow with more blood, as his rage was lit ablaze. 
&quot;I SWEAR....I WILL DEFEAT HIM...HE WILL BE BROUGHT DOWN....On my....honor.&quot;
Neo&#39;s flame of rage began to wither as exhaustion overtook him.
---
&quot;Mister? Hey Mister? Are you okay?&quot;
Neo heard a voice as he began to wake up. A juvenile voice filled with innocence. 
&quot;WHO&#39;S THERE?&quot;
Neo veiled his arm in void energy, and shielded himself with its claws. 
&quot;Mister?&quot;
The voice said again, Neo&#39;s vision began to clear up, a child stood before him. A young boy who seemed no older than 7. 
&quot;What- What the hell are you doing here brat?!&quot;
Neo wanted to kill the child, but the resistance to doing so balanced it out. Why did he hesitate?
&quot;Mister, you&#39;re hurt. Don&#39;t get too worked up.&quot;
&quot;SHUT UP YOU- AGHh&quot;
Neo tried swinging his arm to scare off the kid, but seemed to open up another wound. 
&quot;Aaah! Mister is bleeding again! Hold still!&quot;
The kid ran up to Neo, who was too tired to resist, and began casting healing magic.
&quot;You&#39;re going to make me tired again if you keep moving like this. No more! Understood?&quot;
&quot;Again? Huh? What? Were you already doing this?&quot;
&quot;Yes I was!&quot;, the kid said proudly,&quot;My mommy always told me to use my power to help people, and you needed help, so I did.&quot;
The child&#39;s smile seemed to pierce Neo&#39;s demeanor. He looked away. 
&quot;You&#39;re....You&#39;re a good kid, brat.&quot;
&quot;Hey you called me a brat again! Meanie&quot;
&quot;SHUT UP! AGH&quot;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="55" name="Character Dynamic Ownership" tags="Side-Story" position="992,83" size="100,100">&quot;Useless god!&quot;, shouted Alethia, &quot;You let all this paperwork pile up as you went galavanting through the forest fighting wild beasts again!&quot;

&quot;But the griffins were in the forest this week it was a-&quot;
&quot;I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s a griffin, a Dragon, or your evil twin. You have 3 months of national budget proposals to review and you haven&#39;t even STARTED them.&quot;

&quot;Whoa whoa whoa&quot;, whoa-ed Clay as he walked in, &quot;nobody, and I mean NOBODY, is allowed to copy my character dynamic with Grimstone. If you want to interact with him so badly, find a different gimmick.&quot;

&quot;Hey!&quot;, said Alethia, &quot;You are not the &#39;copyrighter of character dynamics&#39;, Clay. What reason should I have for honoring your stupid sense of ownership over a style of communication? Hm?&quot;

&quot;Plot armor&quot;, Clay looks up to the sky as he awaits the voices of the two losers who authored his accursed life.

From the heavens, two voices sing out in perfect unison, &quot;We promised no such thing in this game.&quot;

&quot;DAMMIT!&quot;, Clay stormed out.&#96;&#96;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="56" name="NOTE" tags="" position="804,4777" size="100,100">At this point Clay has still not seen the wisdom goddess.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="57" name="Rite of the Divine Pact" tags="" position="440,4784" size="100,100">6 days pass and it is now the day before the rite. The scene opens with another fight scene between him and his Mentor. This time, Clay is able to hold his own. He cannot quite win, but he surely won&#39;t lose. Most of this fight is Clay dodging and using magic to aide himself. 
After this last fight, Clay will ask why his mentor can&#39;t himself be a Crusader. His mentor will simply respond, &quot;I wasn&#39;t chosen, our Goddess&#39;s will is hers and hers alone.&quot;
Clay will shrug at this. 

Clay will be called by a servant to go get ready. Skip to when he&#39;s clothed, he&#39;s dressed up all fancily. Clay looks out from his window in the Palace and sees people gathered. The guards lined the palace doors which were wide open. The Palace barrier had been activated. 

Clay will be escorted into the hall, performing the tradition of swearing his oath before the throne of Sofiya while holding his sword(which he won&#39;t be using). Clay is then placed inside of the sarcophagus. As he learned, he will use one of the scarab amulets he was given to drain his mana till he can just barely remain concious. Once he reaches this state, the Amulet will signal Sofiya to step forward and commence the ritual(this is the one time in a year where most people will ever see her). Sofiya uses the blade and pricks her finger, letting a drop of blood fall into one of the crevices of the sarcophagus. Muttering a few words, the blood decomposes into divine essence and fills all the crevices and eventually fills the entirety of the Sarcophagus, Clay feels like he&#39;s being engulfed in flames as this happens. Right as the pain reaches its peak, he suddenly feels an overwhelming sense of strength and regains his senses. As he was instructed from this point onwards, he will remove all 14 Scarab Amulets and present them to Sofiya upon his reawakening. This is when the contract between him and Sofiya is established. Taking a glance upwards he&#39;ll realize that he&#39;s looking at that same girl from earlier, and is fighting to keep his composure. Sofiya returns the blade and the rite is over. A feast is held outside and an artist comes to paint Clay&#39;s portrait to be spread across the nations. 
Clay is then instructed to go to the training arena with Sofiya to activate his Divine Blessing. He is unable to. Sofiya is in shambles.

At this moment, Sofiya&#39;s device named Ra, announces the beginning of the Crusades in one week. The situation looks pretty bad.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="59" name="The Divine Pact" tags="" position="3803,3238" size="100,100">6 days pass and it is now the day before the rite. The scene opens with another fight scene between him and his Mentor. This time, Clay is able to hold his own. He cannot quite win, but he surely won&#39;t lose. Most of this fight is Clay dodging and using magic to aide himself. 
After this last fight, Clay will ask why his mentor can&#39;t himself be a Crusader. His mentor will simply respond, &quot;I wasn&#39;t chosen, our Goddess&#39;s will is hers and hers alone.&quot;
Clay will shrug at this. 

Clay will be called by a servant to go get ready. Skip to when he&#39;s clothed, he&#39;s dressed up all fancily. Clay looks out from his window in the Palace and sees people gathered. The guards lined the palace doors which were wide open. The Palace barrier had been activated. 

Clay will be escorted into the hall, performing the tradition of swearing his oath before the throne of Sofiya while holding his sword(which he won&#39;t be using). Clay is then placed inside of the sarcophagus. As he learned, he will use one of the scarab amulets he was given to drain his mana till he can just barely remain concious. Once he reaches this state, the Amulet will signal Sofiya to step forward and commence the ritual(this is the one time in a year where most people will ever see her). Sofiya uses the blade and pricks her finger, letting a drop of blood fall into one of the crevices of the sarcophagus. Muttering a few words, the blood decomposes into divine essence and fills all the crevices and eventually fills the entirety of the Sarcophagus, Clay feels like he&#39;s being engulfed in flames as this happens. Right as the pain reaches its peak, he suddenly feels an overwhelming sense of strength and regains his senses. As he was instructed from this point onwards, he will remove all 14 Scarab Amulets and present them to Sofiya upon his reawakening. This is when the contract between him and Sofiya is established. Taking a glance upwards he&#39;ll realize that he&#39;s looking at that same girl from earlier, and is fighting to keep his composure. Sofiya returns the blade and the rite is over. A feast is held outside and an artist comes to paint Clay&#39;s portrait to be spread across the nations. 
Clay is then instructed to go to the training arena with Sofiya to activate his Divine Blessing. He is unable to. Sofiya is in shambles.

At this moment, Sofiya&#39;s device named Ra, announces the preparations are Complete, the Crusades will begin tomorrow. The situation looks pretty bad.

The Gods each arrive in Alexandria with their respective Crusaders.
The first Carriage, or rather pair of Carriages, were a bright Gold and a deep Black(with a Gothic Aesthetic). There is a massive crowd in the streets, and soldiers everywhere to keep people in-line. Then follows Morrigan&#39;s carriage which a deep brown mixed with reddish-orange in places, surrounded with Crows. After that is a Carriage colored white and blue that almost looks like it is made of ice. After that is a Carriage of red and black, with soldiers surrounding it.
They arrive at the entrance to the Temple of Wisdom. Clay is at the gate of the temple. A servant announces that Sofiya will now be leaving the temple&#39;s veils. The doors will open revealing Sofiya at walking out with servants preceeding her. She stands at the gate, and Clay is taken aback at the scene.

&quot;As per the ancient custom, come forth and present yourselves.&quot;
Each of the carriages will open. Starting with the first two.
&quot;Solus, God of the Sun.&quot; The area becomes much brighter.
&quot;Luna, Goddess of the Moon.&quot; The lighting returns to normal.
&quot;Morrigan, Goddess of Death.&quot; Upon seeing Clay she will visibly look surprised.
&quot;Vitus, God of Life.&quot; 
&quot;AND LAST AND GREATEST, THE WAR GOD HIMSELF, POLEMOS!&quot; Polemos will leap out, kiss his bicepts, and flex. The other Gods will shake their heads, muttering about him never changing, but Polemos pays no attention to it.

&quot;I, Sofiya, Will be presiding over this Trial of the 2,000th Crusade, of the year 20,000 of the Divine Era. Any objections?&quot; 
&quot;I have a few.&quot; Polemos says.
&quot;No objections-?&quot;
&quot;I just said I have some.&quot;
&quot;Then we shall proceed.&quot;
Polemos sighs heavily.

Sofiya nods to Clay, and it is his turn to do the same.
&quot;As per the ancient custom, come forth and present yourselves.&quot;
&quot;Verina Sunbearer, eldest daughter of the Stargazer House of the Gate of Heaven, and Crusader of The Sun God.&quot;
&quot;Perceus Stargazer, Crusader of Luna.&quot;
&quot;Lugh Tombsword, Crusader of the Death Goddess.&quot; 
&quot;Lily Frostknight, daughter of the Frostknight Clerical Family and Crusader of The Life God.&quot;
&quot;Alethia Ares Polemos VI, 6th and youngest child of Polemos the War God, and 4th Princess of the Ionian Royal Family.&quot;, she says with curtsey. Clay is visibly taken aback, thinking this can&#39;t be the same girl who tried to kidnap him.
&quot;I, Clay-&quot; realizing he has no last name anymore&quot;- disciple of Grimstone, will be serving under Sofiya the Wisdom Goddess, who presides over this Trial of the 2,000th Crusade, of the year 20,000 of the Divine Era.&quot;

The servants of Sofiya will be going to each God&#39;s servants to show them the rooms each will stay at. The Gods will each follow Sofiya into the Temple, followed by the Crusaders being left alone. 

Clay can choose to:
[[Keep Quiet]]
[[Break the Ice]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="61" name="Keep Quiet" tags="" position="3596,3595" size="100,100">If Clay chooses to keep quiet, Alethia will state she will be heading to her room. The others awkwardly agree and head inside. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="62" name="Break the Ice" tags="" position="3998,3598" size="100,100">Clay says, &quot;Man this Crusader stuff sure is showy, I felt so hoity toity the whole time, any more and I would have said &#39;state thy name Crusader!&#39;!&quot; Perceus will burst into laughter agreeing. Lily will try to hold in her laughter. Verina will look away smirking. Lugh be mostly silent, but he does seem to be paying attention.
Alethia will say &quot;Indeed it&#39;s very taxing.&quot;
&quot;Ohoho, so you can be &#39;serious&#39; in social situations too?&quot;, Clay will retort.
&quot;Do you two know each other?&quot;, Verina will ask.
&quot;Not quite, but get a load of this, Ms.Princess over here went and tried to-&quot;, Alethia will toss a dagger in Clay&#39;s direction, everyone looks at Alethia who says &quot;Aah my hand slipped.&quot;
Clay will sigh, and say, &quot;Well I&#39;m assuming I can at least keep my head if I only reintroduce myself. I&#39;m Clay, hobbies include reading, reseaching magic, and selling rare gemstones. No last name, I&#39;m not in any sort of nobility as you all seem to be, not that it matters for the Trial tonight!&quot;
Lugh will point out, &quot;Ah, I&#39;m not a noble either. I&#39;m just in an old Blackmsithing Family. Tombsword is just the name of both our smithery, and our family name because of it.&quot;
&quot;So you&#39;re the blacksmith from the Death Goddess Kingdom? How did Lady Morrigan choose someone of such a peculiar upbringing? Typically they&#39;re in knightly families, no?&quot;, Verina says.
&quot;It&#39;s...a long story&quot;, Lugh says, avoiding the topic.
&quot;I want to know more about you! Sir Stargazer. I&#39;ve heard the legends about your family! Do you truly have the remnant of dead stars hidden under your estate? What do you use them for?&quot;, Lily jumps in.
&quot;Please- Just call me Perceus. As for our estate...well...&quot;
Verina will cut in and say, &quot;I&#39;m sorry but asking such a thing is poor taste at the moment. Such information isn&#39;t given out so freely. Please understand&quot;, Verina tries to spare Perceus from needing to share.
Lily quickly will apologize and step back. 
Perceus, sensing the tension, will try and ease things by asking about Lily, &quot;So uh...Clerical family for Vitus...what&#39;s that like?&quot;
&quot;Oh- uh, me? Well...&quot;, she fumbles with her words, &quot;...The Life God has been very gracious to our family, enabling me to train directly under him to help his Healing Ministry. The Princess would know of our work in The Republic.&quot;
Alethia will nod, stating, &quot;The Theocracy&#39;s support has been pivotal in recent endeavors. You may have heard this already, but on behalf of The War God I extend my gratitude.&quot;
Clay will roll his eyes at all of this. It went from a casual conversation to international diplomacy in an instant. He&#39;s hoping it doesn&#39;t always become like this.
After a while, </tw-passagedata></tw-storydata></div></body></html>
